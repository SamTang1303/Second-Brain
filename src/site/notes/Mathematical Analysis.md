### Chapter 1

#### 1.1 Preliminary Work
##### Axiom 1.1
> [!none] 
> $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[Ordered field|Ordered field]].

##### Axiom 1.2 (The Archimedean Principle)
> [!none] 
> For every number $b\in \mathbb{R}$, there is some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ that is larger than $b$.

##### Theorem 1.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  For any positive number $\epsilon$, there exists a number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than $\epsilon$.

Pick a $\delta>0$ such that $\frac{1}{\delta}=\epsilon$. The AP gives that for some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$
$$
\begin{align}
n&>\delta \\
\frac{1}{n}&< \frac{1}{\delta} = \epsilon
\end{align}
$$

##### Axiom 1.4 (The Well Ordering Principle for $\mathbb{N}$)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ as a least element

##### Theorem 1.5 (The Principle of Mathematical Induction)
> [!none] 
> - [x] 
> Consider a statement $P(N)$ that is defined for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that 
> 1. $P(1)$ is true, and
> 2. for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, if $P(n)$ is true then $P(n+1)$ is true.
> 
> Then $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose the hypotheses are true, but the conclusion is false.

Consider the set $S:=\{ n\in\mathbb{N}|P(n) \text{ is false} \}$. By our initial assumption this set cannot be empty. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well-Ordering Principle for mathbb N|Well-Ordering Principle]] this set has a least element $l$. $P(l-1)$ must be true, otherwise $l-1$ would be in the set, and $l$ would not be the least element. But if $l-1$ is true, then by our first assumption, $P(l-1+1)=P(l)$ must be true. Therefore $P(l)$ is must true, and false (because it is in $S$), giving us our contradiction.

##### Definition 1.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are nonempty sets. Then $A$ is said to be **equinumerous** with $B$ iff there exists a bijection $f:A\to B$. In this case we write $A \sim B$ and say that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality.

##### Definition 1.7
> [!none]
> A set $S$ is said to be **finite** if and only if $S=\emptyset$ or $S \sim \{ 1,\dots ,n\}$, we say that $S$ is **finite with** $n$ **elements** and write $\left| S \right|=n$, where $\left| S \right|$ is referred to as the number of elements in the finite set $S$.

##### Exercise 1.8
> [!none] 
> - [x] Explicity show that the set $\{ North, East, South, West \}$ and the set $\{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ are equinumerous in the sense of [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 7|Definition 1.7]] (i.e., by constructing a bijection between the two sets). Do these sets satisfy definition 1.7 for some $n$?

Consider the function $f:\{ North, East, South, West \} \to \{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ s.t.
$$
\begin{align}
f(North) &= 1 \\
f(East) &= 4 \\
f(South) &= 7 \\
f(West) &= 10
\end{align}
$$
It is trivial to show that $f$ is a 1-1 and onto, and that both sets are equinumerous to the set $\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$.

##### Definition 1.9
> [!none] 
> Let $S$ be a set. Then the **power set of** $S$, denoted $P(S)$ is the set that contains all subsets of $S$.

##### Example 1.10
> [!none] 
> Consider the set $S=\{ 1,2 \}$ with two elements in it. Its power set, $P(S)=\{ \emptyset,\{ 1 \},\{ 2 \},\{ 1,2 \} \}$, is a set with four elements in it

##### Theorem 1.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let  $S$ be a set with $n$ elements in it. Then $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements in it.

If $S$ has one element in it $P(S)=S$, both of which have 1 element in them. When you add an element to any set, the new power set will be the old power set, plus every set in the old power set plus the new element. Thus every time we add a new element we double the elements in the power set. It is easy to show that these two facts, when combined, imply that $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements when $S$ has $n$ elements.

Alternatively, to construct any set we could iterate through every element of the set and either put it in the set, or not. This results in $2^{n}$ different ways we could construct the sets.

##### Definition 1.12
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **countably infinite** (or **denumerable**) if and only if $S \sim \mathbb{N}$. A set $S$ is said to be **countable** if and only if $S$ is finite or countably infinite.

##### Exercise 1.13
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Show that $2\mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{N}$ by identifying a bijection between them.

Consider the function $f:2\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
f(e) = \frac{e}{2}
\end{align}
$$
for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ $f(2n)$ will map to $n$, ensuring that the function is onto. If $f(m)=f(n)$ then $2n=2m$, which implies $n=m$, showing that the function is also 1-1, and thus a bijection.

##### Theorem 1.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The sets $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality (or, put another way: $\mathbb{Z}$ is countably infinite).

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
f(n)&=\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)\qquad n \text{ is even} \\
f(n)&=-\frac{n-1}{2}\qquad n \text{ is odd}
\end{align}
$$
For any positive integer $x$, $f(2x)$ will map to it ($2x$ is guaranteed to be a natural number). For any negative (or = 0) integer $y$, $f(-2y +1)$ will map to $y$. Therefore $f$ is onto.

Suppose $f(m)=f(n)$. WLG, if $m$ is odd, and $n$ is even, then we have:
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{n}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
n&= -m+1 \\
n+m&= 1
\end{align}
$$
But if both $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers their sum must be greater than $1$. Therefore one cannot be even and the other odd.

It's trivial to show the following equations are only true when $n=m$.
$$
\begin{align}
-\frac{n-1}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
\frac{n}{2}&=\frac{m}{2}
\end{align}
$$
Thus $f$ is 1-1 as well, making it a bijection.

#### 1.2 Main Theorems

##### Composition of Two Bijections Lemma
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ are bijections, then the composite function $f \circ g:A\to C$ will be a bijection as well.

This is a fact will be useful in multiple of the following proofs.

First we will prove that for bijections $f:X\to S$ and $g:S\to V$, $g\circ f:X \to V$ is a bijection as well. 

For every element $v\in V$ there exists an element in $x \in X$ such that maps to it (by the definition of $f$ being onto). For every $x$ there is an element $s \in S$ which maps to it, because $g$ is onto. Thus there exists an $s \in S$ that will map to any $v \in V$, so $g \circ f$ in onto.

Next, we must show that $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well.

If $g(f(n))=g(f(m))$ then because $g$ is 1-1, $f(n)=f(m)$. Because $f$ is 1-1 as well that implies $n=m$, so $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well as onto.



##### Theorem 1.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable

If $S\in\mathbb{N}$ is finite, then it is countable by definition.

The meat of the proof lies in proving that $S$ is countable when it is infinite. 

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to S$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
f(1) &= min(S) \\
f(2) &= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1) \}) \\
\vdots \\
f(n)&=min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(n-1) \})
\end{align}
$$

We know that such minimum elements must exist because of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|well ordering principle]]. Our job is now to show that this function is both 1-1 and onto.

Consider the the following set where $x \in S$
$$
S_{x}:=\{ y \in S|y\leq x \} 
$$

Because this set is bounded below (Well Ordering Principle), and above (by x), it is finite, and thus has a cardinality.

For any $x \in S$ consider $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)$. The cardinality of $S_{x}$ is 1+ the number of elements less than $x$ in $S$ (the +1 is because $x$ is included in the set as well). Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|) = min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots f(\left| S_{x}-1 \right|) \})$ take the least element of the set $S$ with all the elements less than $x$ removed. Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)=x$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $x \in S$, $f$ is onto.

We will argue that $f$ is 1-1 by contradiction. If $f$ were not 1-1, then there exists an $n$ and $m$ such that $f(n)=f(m)$ and $n\neq m$. That implies that WLOG, $n<m$. $f(m)= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \})$. Because $n<m$ $f(n)$ must not be in the set $S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \}$. $f(m)$ must in in this set, because it is the least element of it. But $f(m)=f(n)$, so $f(n)$ is in this set. Thus we have our contradiction, showing that $f$ is 1-1.

Therefore, $f$ is 1-1 and onto, making it a bijection, and making the set $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every subset of a countable set is countable.

Suppose $X\subseteq S$ where $S$ is a countable set.
If a set $S$ is countable, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $\mathbb{N}\to S$. Consider the sets $\mathbb{N}':=\{ n \in \mathbb{N}|f(n) \in X \}$. If we use the same function $f$, but change the domain and codomain such that it goes from $\mathbb{N}'\to S$, it is not difficult to see that it is a bijection.

By construction the function is onto, and we already know that it is 1-1. Therefore there $f$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}'$ to $X$. But $\mathbb{N}'$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|Theorem 1.15]] $X$ must be countable as well.

##### Theorem 1.17
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $F$ is a collection of nonempty sets, then the equinumerous relation $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation on $F$.

To show that $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation we must show that it is reflexive ($A\sim A$), symmetric (if$A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$), and transitive (if $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$).

1. Reflexive—If we consider the function $f:A\to A$ for all $a\in A$ such that $f(a)= a$, checking that it is onto and 1-1 is trivial.
2. Symmetry—If $A\sim B$ then there exists a bijection $f$ from $A\to B$ for all $a\in A$, and $b\in B$. The inverse of a bijection is still a bijection, it is easy to verify that $f^{-1}$ is a bijection from $B\to A$. Thus implying that $B\sim A$.
3. Transitive—If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$ then there exists bijections $f$ and $g$ from $A\to B$ and from $B\to C$ respectively. Once again, it is straightforward to verify that the function $f \circ g$ is a bijection from $A \to C$, implying that $A \sim C$.

##### Theorem 1.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. If there exists an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:\mathbb{N} \to T$, then $T$ is countable.

Thus we have a bijection from $S$ to $f(S)$, which is a subset of of $N$. Thus 
First, we will consider the case where there is an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$. $f$ is already 1-1, and if we change the codomain to $f(S)$, then by definition it is onto as well. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|#Theorem 1 15]] because $f(S) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, $f(S)$ is countable. If $f(S)$ is finite it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite as well, and thus countable. If $f(S)$ is not countable then there is a bijection from $f(s)\to \mathbb{N}$.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because we have bijections from $S\to f(S)$ and from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$, there also exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, making $S$ countable.

Now we consider the case where there is a surjection $g:\mathbb{N}\to T$. Consider the class of sets $X_{t}:=\{ n \in\mathbb{N}|g(n)=t \}$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] $X_{t}$ will always have a least element. Thus we construct the set $N:=\{t\in T|min({ X_{t} })\}$. 

If we consider the same $g$, but tweak the domain to $N$ instead of $\mathbb{N}$, it will now be 1-1, because the least element of a set is unique. Thus it is both 1-1 and onto, giving a bijection from $N\to T$. Because $N \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ there is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to N$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because there are bijections from $\mathbb{N} \to N$ and from $N\to T$ there must also be a bijection from $N\to T$, making $T$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets with $T$ countable. If there exists an injection $f:S\to T$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:T\to S$, then $S$ is countable.

Consider the function $\hat{f}:S\to f(S)$ where the only difference between $f$ and $\hat{f}$ is their codomain. $\hat{f}$ is a bijection, and because $f(S)\subseteq T$, it must be countable ([[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]]). If $f(S)$ is finite, then it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite (and thus countable) as well. If $f(S)$ is not finite, then there exists a bijection between $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. Thus there is a bijection from $S\to f(S)$ as well as from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, thus making $S$ countable.

Consider the set $X_{s}:=\{t\in T|g(t)=s\}$. Now we construct the set $T':=\{min(X_{s})|s \in S\}$. Because the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] guarantees that there is only one least element, the function $\hat{g}:T'\to S$ is 1-1 as well as onto, making it a bijection. $T'\subseteq T$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]] $T'$ is countable. We now have a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to T'$ and from $T'\to S$. Thus by the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, making $S$ countable.

##### Lemma 1.20
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so are $A\cup  B$ and $A \times B$.

First we will prove that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $A$ and $B$ are countable there exists bijection $f$ and $g$ such that any element in $A$ or $B$ can be represented as
$$
\displaylines{
a_{n}=f(n)\\
b_{n}=g(n)
}
$$
Let's create a new function $h:\mathbb{N}\to A\cup B$
$$
\begin{align}
h(n)&=a_{\frac{n}{2}}\qquad \text{n is even} \\
h(n)&=b_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\qquad \text{ n is odd}
\end{align}
$$
By theorem [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 18|#Theorem 1 18]] we only must show that $h$ is onto in order to show that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $f$ and $g$ are countable we know any element in set $A$ can be represented as $a_{n}$ and any element in set $B$ can be represented as $b_{n}$. Thus any element of $A\cup B$ can be represented as either $a_{n}$ or $b_{n}$.

For an arbitrary $b_{n}$, $h(2n-1)$ will map to $b_{n}$. For an arbitrary $a_{n}$, $h(2n)$ will map to $a_{n}$. Thus the function is onto and we have proved that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Next we must prove that $A\times B$ is countable as well. We will again use the countability of $A$ and $B$ to represent an arbitrary element of them as $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ respectively.

I don't want to write out the whole rest of the proof, but the following picture should give a good idea that there is a bijection from $N\to A\cup B$.

Where $f(1)$ would be the first element hit by the purple arrow, $f(2)$ the second, and so on.

##### Theorem 1.21
> [!none] 
> - [>]  $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

To prove this we will invoke [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]] to say that $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is countable. Consider the function $f:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{N}^{2}$
$$
f(q)=(a,b)\qquad \text{ Where a/b=q and is in lowest form}
$$

If we show this function to be injective, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 19|#Corollary 1 19]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

Suppose there exists an two rational numbers such that where $q_{1}=\frac{a}{b}\neq \frac{x}{y}=q_{2}$, but $(a,b)=(x,y)$. The second statement, by definition, means that $a=x$ and $b=y$. but if that is true, then $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{x}{y}$ thus we have contradiction, meaning $f$ must be injective, and $\mathbb{Q}$ must be countable.

##### Theorem 1.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable

This proof is really beefy and I don't want to write it down. The skeleton in the book is very thorough and filling in the gaps should not be difficult.

##### Definition 1.23
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **uncountable** if and only if it is fails to satisfy [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 12|#Definition 1 12]]

In other words, for some set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is no bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, and the set is not finite.

##### Definition 1.24
> [!none] 
> If $p$ is an upper bound for a set $S$ and $p \in S$ then we say $p$ is a maximum element of $S$ (denoted $p=max(S)$). The definition for a minimum element is constructed similarly.

##### Definition 1.26
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above. A number $\alpha$ is a least upper bound for $S$ if and only if
> 1. $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $S$ and
> 2. if $y<\alpha$, then there exists some $x \in S$ such that $y<x\leq \alpha$.

Alternatively, for some number $\alpha$ to be the least upper bound for a set, then it must be both greater than or equal to every element in the set, and less than or equal to every other upper bound for $S$.

##### Exercise 1.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=\left\{  0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \dots \right\}$. Is $10$ an upper bound of $S$? Is $2$ an upper bound? What is the least upper bound for $S$? Does $S$ have a maximum element?

For all $n \in N$
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n}&>0\\
-\frac{1}{n}&<0 \\
1-\frac{1}{n}&<1<10
\end{align}
$$
Therefore $10$ is an upper bound for $S$. By the same argument $2$ is as well.

In the last step we showed that $1-\frac{1}{n}<1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $1$ is an upper bound for $S$. Consider any number $y<1$. by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\exists m \in \mathbb{N}| \frac{1}{m}<1-y$. Thus from rearranging that inequality we get
$$
y<1-\frac{1}{m}
$$
Because $m$ is a natural number, the term on the right will be an element of the set. Thus we have shown that for any $y<1$ there exists a number $>y$ and less than $1$ in $S$. Thus by the definition of a supremum $1$ is the least upper bound of $S$.

##### Lemma 1.28
> [!none] 
> If a nonempty set in $S$ has a least upper bound, then that least upper bound is unique. In other words, $S$ cannot have two different least upper bounds.

Suppose we have two numbers $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ that are least upper bounds for a set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We will argue that they must be the same number by contradiction. If they were not, then WLOG $x<y$. But $x$ is an upper bound, so $y$ cannot be the least upper bound if $x$ is less than it. Thus we have our contradiction and every least upper bound is unique.

##### Definition 1.29
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded below. A number $\beta$ is the **greatest lower bound** for $S$ (denoted $\beta =inf(S)$) if and only if

##### Axiom 1.30 (The Axiom of Completeness)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$. Equivalently: Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 1.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Why are the two statements of the Axiom of Completeness equivalent?

For some some $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded blow, consider the set $B:=\{b \in \mathbb{R}|\forall x \in S, b\leq x\}$. This set is bounded above by every element of $S$, so the Axiom of Completeness says $m=\text{ sup}(B)$ must exists. Because every element in $S$ is an upper bound for $B$, $m\leq S$. Because $B$ is the set of upper bounds for $S$, by definition of a least upper bound, $m>$ every bound for $S$. Thus is satisfies both the criteria to be greatest lower bound for $S$.

The exact same process can be carried out to show that if we assume a set bounded below has a greatest lower bound, then any set must have a greatest upper bound. Thus the two formulations of the Axiom of Completeness are the same.

##### Exercise 1.35

In this proof we will rely on the results of [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 22|#Theorem 1 22]], [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 21|#Theorem 1 21]], and [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]], which state, respectively, that
1. $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable,
2. $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, and
3. The union of two countable sets is countable as well.

We will prove that $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is not countable by contradiction. Assume that it is countable. Now consider the set $\mathbb{Q}\cup \mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$. Because both of these sets are countable, their union must be as well. But we know what their union is; by definition it must be $\mathbb{R}$, which is uncountable. Thus we have our contradiction and the irrationals must be uncountable.

4. Yes it is. For any natural number $n$, $0=0$ and $\frac{1}{n+1}< \frac{1}{n}$

##### Theorem 1.39 (The Nested Interval Property)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $\{ I_{n} \}$ is a collection of nested, nonempty intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{R}$. Then the collection $\{ I_{n} \}$ has a nonempty intersection—in other words, there exists $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p$ is an element of $I_{n}$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

Consider the set $A:=\{n \in \mathbb{N}| a_{n} \}$. We know that $b_{1}$ is an upper bound on this set, because for any $a_{n}$, $b_{n}$ is greater than it, and $b_{1}<b_{n}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}>1$. Thus we can invoke the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness|#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness]] and say that $a=\text{ sup}(A)$ exists.

By the definition of a supremum, $a\geq a_{n}$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$a$ must also be less than or equal to every $b_{n}$. To show this fact we must first prove that any $b_{k}$ is greater than $a_{i}$ $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. If this were not the case, and there were some $a_{i}$ such that $a_{i}>b_{k}$, then there must also be an $b_{i}$ such that $b_{i}>a_{i}$. But this would mean that all elements in the $i$th interval are greater than all elements in the $k$th interval, so neither could be a subset of the other. Thus every $b_{n}$ must be greater than every $a_{i}$. Using this fact, if $a>b_{k}$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then there would be another upper bound, $b_{k}$, which is less than $a$, contradicting the definition of a supremum.

Therefore
$$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n}\qquad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
$$
By construction thus must mean that $a$ is in every interval $I_{n}$.

##### Exercise 1.40
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Note that the hypothesis in the statement of the Nested Interval Property includes the assumption that each interval looks like $[a_{n},b_{n}]$. Would the theorem be hold for other types of nonempty intervals?

Nothing would change in our argument until the last line. 
$$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n} \qquad \forall  n \in \mathbb{N}
$$

But this only implies that $a$ must be in the set $[a_{n}, b_{n}]$ *because the endpoints are included*. If instead it was in the form $(a_{n},b_{n}]$, or $(a_{n},b_{n})$, then we could have $a=a_{n}$, which would satisfy the inequality above, but not be included in those sets.

Consider the intervals $I_{n}=$ $\left( 0, \frac{1}{n} \right]$. For any number there will always be a $\frac{1}{n}$ smaller than it ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]]), so there will be a set it is not included in. This is only possible because the supremum of the left endpoints = 0, and because they are open intervals $0$ is not included in any of them.

##### Example 1.41
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ represent the trunction of $\pi$to $n$ decimal places, and let $b_{n}=a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}$. Then define $J_{n}=[a_{n},b_{n}]$. It follows that

> Show that $J_{1}\subseteq J_{2}\subseteq J_{3}\dots$ Now define $I_{n}=J_{n}\cap \mathbb{Q}$. In a world consisting of only rational numbers, $\{ I_{n} \}$ constitutes a collection of nonempty, nested intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{Q}$. Does it follow that there is some number $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p$ is an element in **every** $I_{n}$?

For any natural number $n$, $\frac{1}{10^{n}}>0$, so $a_{n}<b_{n}$. $a_{n+1}$ must be greater than $a_{n}$ (or, if the next decimal is 0, equal to $a_{n}$), because it is just $a_{n}$ plus the next decimal. $b_{n+1}=a_{n+1}+\frac{1}{10^{n+1}}<a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}=b_{n}$. Therefore each successive interval must be a subset of the last.

No, it does not imply that there will be a rational number $p$ that is in the intersection of every one of these sets. The Nested Interval Property only implies that there will be a **real number** such that it is in the intersection of all of the sets.

##### Exercise 1.50*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number.

We must show that for any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ where $a<b$ there exists a rational number $q$ such that $a<q<b$.

First, consider the case where $0\leq a<b$.

From [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we know that there exists a $n \in \mathbb{N}|$ $0<\frac{1}{n} < \left| b-a \right|$. Let $q=\frac{1}{n}$, where $q$ is clearly rational.

Consider the set $S=\{n \in \mathbb{N}|b\leq n\cdot q\}$. Because $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] allows us to produce an $m =min(S)$. $m-1$ must not be in $S$, otherwise $m$ would not be the least element of $S$ (we are guaranteed that it is in the naturals because $q<b$, so 1 cannot be the least element, thus $m-1\geq1$). By the construction of $S$ this implies that $(m-1)\cdot q <b$. 

$m$ must be in $S$, by the definition of a least element. This implies $mq\geq  b$.
$$
\begin{align}
mq&\geq b \\
mq-q&\geq b-q>b-(b-a) \qquad \text{because }q<b-a\\ 
(m-1)q&>a
\end{align}
$$
Therefore we have $a<(m-1)q<b$. Because $q$ is rational and $m-1$ is a natural number, $(m-1)q$ must be rational as well, and we have thus proved for any $0\leq a<b$ there is a rational number in between $a$ and $b$.

The case where $a<0<b$ is trivial because by construction $0$ a rational number within the interval.

Lastly we consider the case where $a<b\leq0$. Consider the interval between $-b$ and $-a$. Because $a,b$ are negative, $-a,-b$ must be positive and so we can use our previous work to produce a number $q \in Q|-b<q<-a$. negating this inequality produces $a<-q<b$, which is the desired result.

Thus for any $a$ and $b$ there will always be a rational number in between them.

##### Exercise 1.51*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $a<b$, then the open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] each of them will produce a unique rational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of rationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Corollary 1.52*
> [!none] 
> - [x] Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one irrational number.

We will prove this statement by contradiction. Assume it is false, and there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that in between them there are **no** irrational numbers. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there exists a $b \in \mathbb{Q}|a<q<b$. Consider an arbitrary $x \in (a-q,b-q)$.
$$
\begin{align}
a-q&<x<b-q \\
a&<x+q<b
\end{align}
$$
Therefore $x+q \in (a,b)$ and by our initial assumption $x+q$ is rational. But $q$ is rational, so $(x+q)-q=x$ must be rational as well. Thus all elements in the set $(a-q,b-q)$ are rational. From now on let $a'=a-q$ and $b'=b-q$.

Now consider the interval $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$, for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $s \in (n\cdot a', n\cdot b')$
$$
\begin{align}
n\cdot a' < s < n\cdot b' \\
a'< \frac{s}{n}<b'
\end{align}
$$
Therefore $\frac{s}{n} \in (a',b')$ and is rational. But if $\frac{s}{n}$ is rational, then $\frac{s}{n} \cdot n=s$ must be rational as well. Thus any element of an interval of the form $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ will be rational.

Here we will take a moment to remember that
$$
\begin{align}
a&<q<b \\
a'=a-q&<0<b-q=b'
\end{align}
$$
$n$ is any arbitrary natural number, so as we increase $n$ it will have the effect of scaling up this interval to any desired size while keeping all its members rational. This allows us to show that irrational numbers don't exist, which is obviously false. But for the sake of precision let us take a specific natural number for our contradiction.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there will be an $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m> \frac{3}{b'}$. Therefore $b' \cdot m >3$. $m\cdot b'>3>\sqrt{ 3 }$, and $\sqrt{ 3 }>0>a'\cdot m$. This implies that $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is in the interval $(m\cdot a',m\cdot b')$, making it rational. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 32|#Theorem 1 32]] $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational, giving us our contradiction and completing the proof.

##### Exercise 1.53*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  if $a<b$, then the interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many irrational number.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 52|#Exercise 1 52]] each of them will produce a unique irrational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of irrationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Exercise 1.54 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove that if $z$ is an upper bound for $A$, and $z \in A$, then it must be true that $z=sup(A)$.

- Because $z$ is already established as an upper bound, the only thing which we have to show is that $z\leq b$, where $b$ is any other upper bound.
- We will prove by contradiction
- Assume there is an upper bound $b<z$ outside of the set. But since $z$ is in the set it is not an upper bound. Therefore we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.55*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Archimedean Principle was presented as an axiom. Show that, in fact, the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

Arch: For any b in the Real Numbers there exists a natural number $n > b$.

Axiom: For any nonempty subset of R which is bounded above there exists a least upper bound.

We will prove this by contradiction. Our initial assumption is that the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle, which is logically equivalent to the Archimedean Principle being true and the Axiom of Completeness being false.

Let us assume that the Axiom of Completeness is true and that the Archimedean Principle is not true.

That the Archimedean Principle is not true implies that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \ngtr b$. Then $b$ would be an upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$. By the Axiom of Completeness, $\mathbb{N}$ must have a least upper bound as it is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and it is bounded above.

Let us call this least upper bound $m$. If $m$ is a least upper bound, then $m - 1$ cannot be a bound to $\mathbb{N}$. Since $m - 1$ is not an upper bound, that implies that $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} | n > m - 1$. This in turn implies that $m < n + 1$. However, because the $\mathbb{N}$ are closed under addition, $n + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and because $m$ is now shown to be less than a natural number, it cannot be the least upper bound. This is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be false. That the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle is untrue. We have therefore proven that the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

##### Exercise 1.56*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Axiom of Completeness stipulates, in a very specific way, that the set of real number, $\mathbb{R}$, completes the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$. To appreciate this, suppose that you are working in a number universe consisting of only rational numbers. Show that there does exist a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $S$ has a rational upper bound and yet $S$ has no rational least upper bound.

Consider the set $S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} | x \cdot x < 2\}$.

Let us find the least upper bound $s$ of the set $S$. We propose $\sqrt{2}$ as $s$, and will show that both $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ and that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

First let us demonstrate that $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ with a proof by contradiction. Suppose $\exists x \in S | x > \sqrt{2}$. Then $x^{2} > 2$, and by the definition of $S$, $S$ cannot contain $x$. Thus, our initial assumption must be false, and $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$.

Second let us demonstrate that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$, also with a proof by contradiction. Let us then suppose that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | b < s$. Then by the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ proved in exercise 1.5, we know that $\exists n \in \mathbb{Q} | b < n < s$. From this we know that $n^{2} < s^{2}$, or that $n^{2} < 2$. Since $n \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $n^{2} < 2$, by definition of $S$, $n \in S$. Because $n \in S$ and $n > b$, $b$ cannot be an upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; therefore $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

Therefore, $s = \sqrt{2}$ is the least upper bound of $S$. It should be clear that $S$ has no end of rational upper bounds; however $S$ has a irrational least upper bound.

##### Exercise 1.57*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose that $p$ is a prime number. Show that there is no rational number $z$ that satifies $z^{2}=p$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose there is a $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\frac{a}{b} = z$ and $z^{2}=p$, and $\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest form.
$$
\begin{align}
\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{2} &= p \\
a^{2} &= pb^{2}
\end{align}
$$
From this statement we can see that $p$ is a factor of $a$. If it were not then $a^{2}$ would not have it as a factor either, which it clearly does. Thus we can write $a = px$, where $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
$$
\begin{align}
(px)^{2} &= pb^{2} \\
px^{2} &= b^{2}
\end{align}
$$
By the same argument we can see that $p$ is also a factor of $b$. But if $p$ is a factor of both $b$ and $a$, then $\frac{a}{b}$ is not in lowest form, and we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.58*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $p$ is a positive number. Use the Axiom of Completeness to show that there is a number $z \in\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $z^{2}=p$.

Let $s$ be the least upper bound of the set $S=\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^{2} < p\}$.

Let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$. We begin by assuming that $s^{2} < p$.

Consider $(s + \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$$
\begin{gather*}
	(s + \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$$

Since $0 < \epsilon < 1$, $\epsilon^{2} < \epsilon$, and since $p > s$:

$$
\begin{gather*}
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1)
\end{gather*}
$$

Let us now choose an $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2}$.

$$
\begin{gather*}
	\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2} \\
	s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p
\end{gather*}
$$

From our initial comparison $s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon$ and $s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p$ we may conclude that $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$.

Since $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$, $(s + \epsilon) \in S$ and $(s + \epsilon) > s$. Therefore, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$ and we have run into a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong and $s^{2} \nless p$.

Now let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \ngtr p$. Let us then initially assume that $s^{2} > p$.

Consider $(s - \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$$
\begin{gather*}
	(s - \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$$

Since $0 < \epsilon$, $s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon$. Let us then choose an $\epsilon$ such that $s \epsilon < s^{2} - p$. Then $s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$, $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$, $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ by the definition of $S$. Since $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ and it is smaller than $s$, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be incorrect and $s^{2} \ngtr p$.

Since we have shown through contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$ and $s^{2} \ngtr p$, $s^{2}$ must equal $p$. Thus $s$ is a real number which satisfies $s^{2} = p$.

##### Exercise 1.59 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $S$ is a bounded nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Define the related set $T =\{ -x|x \in S \}$. Prove that $T$ is bounded and that $\text{sup}(T)=-\text{inf}(S)$ and $\text{inf}(T)=-\text{sup}(S).$

- Show that $-\text{inf(S)}$ is an upper bound for T
- Show that the negative of the set of all the lower bounds of T is the same as the set of all of the upper bounds for t. 
- Show that the negative of every lower bound  is an upper bound.
- Since inf(T) is greater than every lower bound the negative of both with mean -inf(T) is less than every upper bound.
- Thus it is both greater than every element in the set, and it is less than every bound, making it = sup(T).

##### Exercise 2.2
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $a<b$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $S=(a,b)$. Prove that for each $c \in S$, there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(c)\subseteq S$. (Is this true if we used $S=(a,b]$?)

Let $\epsilon = min\left\{  \frac{\left| c-a \right|}{2}, \frac{\left| b-c \right|}{2}  \right\}$. 
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $a$:
$$
c-\frac{c-a}{2}=\frac{c}{2} + \frac{a}{2}> \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}>a \\
$$
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $b$:
$$
c+ \frac{b-c}{2}=\frac{b}{2}+\frac{c}{2}< \frac{b}{2}+\frac{b}{2}=b
$$
From these cases it is clear that $\forall x \in N_{\epsilon}$ will be inside $S$. This is not true for the interval $S=(a,b]$ because $b+\epsilon>b$ for any value of $\epsilon>0$.

For any $2>\epsilon>0$ the point $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in (0,2]$. If $\epsilon\geq2$ the point $1 \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $1 \in (0,2]$. Therefore, by definition $2$ is an accumulation point of the set $(0,2]$

Given an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there will be a rational number in between the interval $(\pi,\epsilon)\subseteq N_{\epsilon}^{*}(\pi )$.

##### Exercise 2.9 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  What does it mean for a point p to not be an accumulation point of a set $S$? Show that neither $2$ nor $\pi$ are accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

It means that there exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that there are no points in the set within that $\epsilon$ radius of $p$.

For example, take $\epsilon=0.1$. There are no integers in the sets $(1.9,2.1)\text{ \\ }\{ 2 \}$ or the set $(\pi-0.1,\pi+0.1)\text{ \\ }\{ \pi \}$. Thus they are no accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

#### 2.2 Main Theorems

##### Exercise 2.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that $S$ is closed if and only if $S'\subseteq S$.

Proof by contradiction: If this were false there would be an element $x \in S'$ and $x \cancel{ \in } S$ and $S$ would have to be closed. This would mean that $x \in S\cup S'$, but we have already established that $x$ is not in $S$, therefore $S\neq S\cup S'$, meaning it is not closed, and we have a contradiction. 

##### Exercise 2.13

2. $4$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)\cap(0,4)$
3. $2$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $2+\epsilon \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(2)\cap(0,4)$ 

##### Exercise 2.14

$cl(S)=[0,4]$

##### Theorem 2.15
> [!none]
> - [>]  Let $A,B\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $(A\cup B)'$, then $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$.

We will prove by contraposition. The above statement is logically equivalent to: if $x \notin A'$ and $x \notin B'$, then $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

By the definition of $x$ not being in $A'$, there exists a $\epsilon$ such that $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap A$ is an empty set. Likewise there must exists a $\delta$ such that $N_{\delta }^{*}(x)\cap B$ is empty as well. WLOG $\delta<\epsilon$. Because $N_{\delta}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\epsilon  }^{*}(x)$ there are no points from $A$ *or* $B$ that are in the deleted delta-neighborhood of $x$. This is is essentially the definition of what it means for $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

##### Corollary 2.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of two closed sets is closed.

Let $A$ and $B$ both be closed sets. For any $x \in (A\cup B)'$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 15|#Theorem 2 15]] $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$. But because $A$ and $B$ are closed $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$, and thus $A',B' \subseteq A\cup B$, and $x \in A\cup B$. This shows that $(A\cup B)'\subseteq A\cup B$, which by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] makes $A\cup B$ closed.

##### Lemma 2.16.1
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $(a,b)\cap S'$ is nonempty, then $(a,b)\cap S$ is nonempty as well

From the hypothesis of the statement, we know there exists an element $x \in (a,b)$ and $x \in S'$. Because $x \in S'$ there must then exists $y \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ for all $\epsilon>0$. Let $c=min(\{ \left| b-x \right|,\left| x-a \right| \})$. Consider an $\epsilon|\epsilon<c$. $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)=(x-c,x+c)$. By the construction of $c$, $x-c\geq a$ and $x+c\leq b$. This implies that $y$ must be in $(a,b)$. Thus we have produced an element $y \in (a,b)\cap S$.

##### Theorem 2.17
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Given any set $S$, the set $S'$ is a closed set

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] we must show that $S''\in S'$. This means that if $y \in S''$, for an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ we must produce an element $x$ such that $x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$.

By definition of $y \in S''$, $\forall \delta >0$ $N_{\delta}^{*}(y)\cap S'\neq \emptyset$. Let $\delta=\epsilon$ in this case. Because the set is nonempty we can product an element $z$ inside of it. By construction this $z \in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon)$ and $z \in S'$. Because $z \in S'$ we can produce an $x$ such that for an arbitrary $\alpha$, $N_{\alpha}^{*}(z)\cap S\neq \emptyset$. Because $\delta$ is arbitrary, if we set it $=min\{ \left| (y+\epsilon) -z \right|, \left| z- (y-\epsilon) \right| \}$ $x$ is guaranteed to be in the interval $(y-\epsilon, y+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because $x$ must also be in $S$ we have assured that for an arbitrary $\epsilon$ $\exists x|x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$. Thus that set is not empty and we have accomplished our goal.

##### Corollary 2.18
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Given a set $S \subseteq  R$, the set $cl(S)$ is a closed set.

By definition $cl(S):=S\cup S'$. Given any accumulation point of $cl(S)'$ we must show that it is in $cl(S)$ ([[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). If $y \in cl(S)'$ then for all $\epsilon>0$ there $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap(S\cup S')$ must be nonempty. This is logically equivalent to $(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S)\cup(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')\neq \emptyset$. This means that there exists a $z$ such that $z \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ *or* $z \in (N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')$. If the first case is true, then by definition $y \in S'$. In the second case, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 2 16 1|#Lemma 2 16 1]] $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ must be nonempty, which again by definition makes $y \in S'$. Thus we have showed that for any point in $cl(S)'$, it must also be in $cl(S)=S\cup S'$, and by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]], it must be closed

##### Theorem 2.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of a finite number of closed sets is a closed set.

We must show that for any natural number $n\leq2$ the union of $n$ closed sets are closed.

Base case: for $n=2$, we simply have to refer to [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]].

Inductive hypothesis: Suppose that the union of $n$ closed sets is closed. We must show that the union of $n+1$ sets is closed.

By the inductive hypothesis for any sequence of closed sets $\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}$ is closed. $\cup_{i=2}^{n+1}C_{i}=\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}\cup C_{n+1}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]] this must also be closed, and by mathematical induction the union of any finite set of closed intervals will be closed as well.

##### Theorem 2.20
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The intersection of any collection of closed sets is a closed set.

Suppose $\{S_{i}\}$ is a collection of closed sets, either finite or infinite. We must show that if for all values of $i$ $S_{i}$ will be closed, then the intersection of all of these sets is closed. We will do this through contradiction. 

Assume that the theorem is false, and there exists a collection of sets $S_{i}$ which are all closed, yet their intersection (denoted $\cap S_{i}$) is not closed. $\cap S_{i}$ not being closed implies that $(\cap S_{i})'\nsubseteq\cap S_{i}$ (by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). Thus
$$
\begin{align}
\exists x &\in (\cap S_{i})'|x \notin S_{i}, \text{ where }S_{i}\text{ is at least one of the sets}\\
\forall \epsilon&>0(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap(\cap S_{i})\neq \emptyset)
\end{align}
$$
This implies that for any $S_{i}$, $N_{\epsilon^{*}}(x)\cap S_{i}\neq0$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point for every $S_{i}$. Because each $S_{i}$ is closed this guarantees that $x \in S_{i}$, for all $S_{i}$ as well, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]'s formulation of the definition of being closed. But this contradicts what we said earlier, finishing our proof.

##### Exercise 2.30*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if every nonempty interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.

Let $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. From the definition of dense, we know that $\mathbb{R}\subseteq\text{cl}(S)$, or equivalently, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. This means that every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is either an element of $S$ or is an accumulation point of $S$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $x\in\mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $S$, then we know that $(a,b)$ contains an element of $S$. If $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, then we know for some $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. In other words, the deleted neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one element of $S$. If $\epsilon<\text{min}\{|x-a|,|x-b|\}$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\subseteq (a,b)$. This means that at least one element of $S$ is also in $(a,b)$.

Therefore, if $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, then every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.


Suppose now that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S. This means for some distinct $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ where $\epsilon>0$ and some distinct $x\in\mathbb{R}$, the intervals $(x-\epsilon,x)$ and $(x,x+\epsilon)$ will each contain an element of $S$.

We can see that $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^*(x)$, and since there is at least two elements of $S$ in $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. This means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.

Since every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be described as an accumulation point of $S$, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. Therefore if every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S, then $S$ is dense in $R$.
 
##### Corollary 2.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  $Q$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

In order for $\mathbb{Q}$ to be dense in $\mathbb{R}$, it must be the case that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, since between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number. This means every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 2.38*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use induction to prove that $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, each of length $(\frac{1}{3})^{n}$.

Base case: $C_{0}$ is the closed interval $[0,1]$ which clearly has length $1=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{0}$ , and there is only one interval ($1=2^{0}$). Thus the base case checks out.

Inductive hypothesis: We assume that $C_{n}$ has a $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, and we must show that $C_{n+1}$ has $2^{n+1}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

In definition of the Cantor set we were told that to construct the next "partial Cantor set" set you take each interval of the previous set and remove the open third of the interval. When you do this you split each interval into two intervals, doubling the number of intervals. Thus if $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, $C_{n+1}$ will have $2^{n}\cdot2=2^{n+1}$ intervals. When the middle third of each interval is removed the split intervals will have $\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the interval they were split from. So if each interval in $C_{n}$ has length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, then each interval in $C_{n+1}$ will have length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified, and by induction for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $C_{n}$ will have $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

##### Exercise 2.39*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Find at least three distinct points in the Cantor Set.

When we remove the middle third of each interval the endpoints of each interval are never removed. Thus an endpoint for $C_{n}$ will be an endpoint for every $C_{m}$ where $m>n$. In addition, because every $C_{n}$ is a subset of every $C_{l}$ where $l<n$, every endpoint of $C_{n}$ will be contained in $C_{l}$. Thus any endpoint of any of the sets will be in the Cantor set. Consider the set $\left\{  0,1, \frac{1}{3}  \right\}$. All the elements in the set are endpoints of $C_{1}$, so they must be in the Cantor set.

##### Exercise 2.40*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor Set is a closed set.

Every $C_{n}$ is a union of a finite number of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]] every $C_{n}$ is closed. Because $C_{\infty}$ is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, which are all closed, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $C_{\infty}$ must be closed as well.

##### Exercise 2.41*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor set is nowhere **dense**.

To be nowhere dense there must be no $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. We will prove this by contradiction.

Assume there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. Because the Cantor set is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, $(a,b)$ must be a subset of every $C_{n}$. Let $c= \left| a-b \right|$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] for some natural number $m$, $\frac{1}{m}<c$. $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{m}< \frac{1}{m}$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $C_{n}$ it will be made up of intervals of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. Thus we can produce a $C_{m}$ which is the union of a disjoint set of intervals, each of which are smaller than $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)$ cannot be a subset of $C_{m}$, otherwise $C_{m}$ would contain an interval larger than $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. This is contradiction, showing that our initial assumption is false, and the Cantor set must be **nowhere dense**.

### Chapter 3

#### 3.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 3.1
> [!none] 
> Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. A point $p \in S$ is said to be an interior point of $S$ if and only if there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(p)\subseteq S$. The set of all interior points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as the interior of $S$) will be denoted by $S^{\circ}$.

##### Definition 3.2
> [!none] 
> A point $q \in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}(q)$ contains at least one element of $S$ and at least one element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. The set of all boundary points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as **the boundary of $S$**) will be denoted by $\partial(S)$.

##### Exercise 3.3 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For a set $S \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\partial (S)=\partial (\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

If $T= \mathbb{R}\setminus S$, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus T=S$. For every boundary point no matter how small of an interval around that point there is there must be an element of $S$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But any element of $S$ is an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus T$, and every element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is an element of $T$. Therefore the point must be a boundary point for $T=\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well. Showing the implication the other way is very simple.

##### Exercise 3.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $S'$ is a subset of $\partial(S)$.

This is false. Consider the set $(0,1)$. $\frac{1}{2}$ is an accumulation point, but not a boundary point.

##### Exercise 3.5
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $\partial(S)$ is a subset of $S'$.

This is also false. Consider the set $\{ 1 \}$. In this set $1$ is a boundary point, but not an accumulation point. I believe if the definition of a boundary point was a deleted epsilon neighborhood instead of a regular epsilon neighborhood, then this would be true.

##### Exercise 3.6

##### Definition 3.8
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is said to be an **open set** if and only if $S^{\circ}=S$.

##### Theorem 3.9
> [!none] 
> - [>]  An interval of the form $(a,b):=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}|a<x<b \}$ is an open set.

The definition of an interior point makes it clear that it must be an element of the set. Thus we only have to show that $(a,b)\subseteq (a,b)^{\circ}$.

For any point $x \in (a,b)$, if you take $\varepsilon=min\{ \left| x-a \right|,\left| b-x \right| \}$, then the interval $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will be contained in the set, making $x$ an interior point of $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)=(a,b)^{\circ}$.

##### Exercise 3.10

2. $S=[0,5]\cup \mathbb{Q}$
	1. Not open. $5 \in S$, but $5 \notin S^{\circ}$ .
3. $S=\mathbb{Z}$
	1. Not open. $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, but $1 \notin S^{\circ}$
4. $S=\left\{  \frac{n-1}{n}|n \in\mathbb{N}  \right\}$
	1. Not open. $\frac{3}{4} \in S$, but $\frac{3}{4} \notin S^{\circ}$.

##### Exercise 3.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: the set $\mathbb{R}$, as well as the empty set $\emptyset$, are both open and closed.

We will prove this statement true.

The empty set has no interior points, so it is equal to its interior, making it technically open. It also has no accumulation points, so they must be a subset of the set, making it also closed.

For any real number, any open interval containing the number will be a subset of the real numbers. This makes every real number part of the interior of $\mathbb{R}$, and thus making it open. Every accumulation point of $\mathbb{R}$ must be in $\mathbb{R}$, making it closed as well. 

##### Exercise 3.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $T$ is not open, then $T$ is closed.

We will prove this false. Consider the set $(0,1]$. This set is not open, but it is also not closed, providing a counterexample to the statement.

#### 3.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 3.13
> [!none] 
> - [>]  A set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. In other words, a set $S$ is open if and only if no boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

First we prove the forward direction: If $S$ is open, then all of the boundary are not elements of $S$.

For any $x \in \partial(S)$ by definition for all $\varepsilon>0$ the neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain a point in $S$ and a point not is $S$. Thus $N_{\varepsilon}$ cannot be a subset of $S$ because it contains an element not in $S$, meaning the point is not in the interior of $S$.

Next we prove the backward direction: If no boundary points are elements of $S$, then $S$ is an open set.

We will prove this by contraposition. The following statement is logically equivalent to the problem statement: If $S$ is not open, then there exists a boundary point which is an element of $S$.

If $S$ is not open that means there exists a point $x \in S|x \notin S^{\circ}$. Therefore for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain an element not in $S$. But because $x \in S$ it contains both a point in $S$, and a point not in $S$, making it a boundary point in $S$.

##### Lemma 3.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $S'\setminus S=\partial(S)\setminus S$.

Suppose $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain a point in $S$ because $x\in S'$. But because the neighborhood contains $x$, it also contains a point not in $S$. Thus it satisfies the criteria to be a boundary point and is not in $S$, so $x \in \partial(S)\setminus S$.

Now suppose $y$ is a boundary point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain one point in $S$ and one point not in $S$. Because $y \notin S$, the point in $S$ must be in $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$ this guarantees that $y \in S'$ by definition. We also know that $y \notin S$, so $y \in S'\setminus S$.

Because we have proved that $S'\setminus S\subseteq \partial(S)\setminus S$ and $\partial(S)\setminus S\subseteq S'\setminus S$, the two sets must be equal.

##### Lemma 3.14.1
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is a boundary point of $S$, and is not contained in $S$, then $x$ is an accumulation point.

By the definition of a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain at least one element of $S$. Because $x \notin S$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain the element of $S$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.
##### Theorem 3.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is a closed set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq S$. In other words, a set $S$ is closed if and only if all boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

Suppose $S$ is closed. We must show that all of its boundary points are elements of $S$. Let $x \in \partial(S)$. 
Suppose $x \notin S$, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 3 14 1|#Lemma 3 14 1]] it would be an accumulation point of $S$. Because $S$ is closed this implies that $x \in S$. This is a contradiction, meaning our assumption must be false and $x$ must be in $S$.

Now suppose all of the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$. We must show that $S$ is closed. Let us do this through contradiction.
Assume that all the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$, but $S$ is not closed. By the definition of $S$ not being closed, there must be a $x \in S'|x\notin S$. This means that for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain an element of $S$. $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ contains an element of $S$. Because it contains $x$ as well, it contains an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well, thus satisfying the definition of a boundary point. This means that $x$ is a boundary point of $S$ not within $S$, contradicting our initial assumption and completing the proof.

##### Corollary 3.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

First we must show the forward direction: If $S\in R$ is an open set, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

If $S$ is open, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $\partial(S)\subseteq(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. Therefore $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. Therefore by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

Now we must show the backward direction: If $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set, then $S$ is an open set.

By definition [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ being closed we know that $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But this implies that $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. So by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $S$ is open.

Q.E.D.

##### Theorem 3.17
> [!none]
> - [x]  The intersection of finitely many open sets is open

Consider $S=\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}S_{i}$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $S_{i}$ is open. Now consider the set $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$. Because $S_{i}$ is open [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]] guarantees $\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$ must be closed. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must then be closed because it is a union of a finite number of closed intervals ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]]). Then again by Corollary 3.16 $S$ must be open if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

##### Theorem 3.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of any collection of open sets is open.

Let $X$ be any collection of open sets. Let our set $S=\bigcup\limits_{O\in S}O$ where every $O \in S$ is open. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcap\limits_{O\in S}\mathbb{R}\setminus O$. Because every $O \in S$ is open, $\mathbb{R}\setminus O$ must be closed by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]]. This means that $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is the intersection of a collection of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must be closed. Because $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed, $S$ must be open by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]].

##### Example 3.19
> [!none] 
> $F=\{ (1,4),(1,2),(3,7) \}$ is a collection of three open sets. Notice that the interval $(1,2)$ is an element of $F$ (not a subset of $F$) so we can write $(1,2)\in F$. At the same time we have that $\{ (1,2) \}\subseteq  F$.

$0 \in [0,1]$ is not in any interval of the form $(0,i)$ where $i \in I=\mathbb{N}$. Thus it is not "covered" by $F$.

##### Exercise 3.23
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set. Show that there exists an open cover of $S$, $F=\{ O_{i}: \in I \}$ such that every open set $O_{i}$ in $F$ is a subset of $S$.

Consider the open set $(0,1)$. If we set $O_{1}=\left( 0, \frac{3}{4} \right)$, and $O_{2}=\left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)$. Note that both sets are subsets of $(0,1)$. Let $I=\{ 1,2 \}$. Let $F=\{ O_{i}|i \in I \}$. $\bigcup\limits_{O \in F}O=(0,1)$ and thus $F$ is an open cover comprised of only subsets of $(0,1)$.

#### 3.3 Follow Up Work

##### Exercise 3.25
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Develop complete proofs of all the lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Exercise 3.26*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or Disprove: Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S\setminus S'=S\setminus \partial(S)$.

We will prove this statement false. Consider the natural numbers. Clearly the set $N_{0.5}^{*}(1)\cap \mathbb{N}$ empty, and thus by definition $1$ cannot be an accumulation point and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}'$.

We must now show that $1$ *is* a boundary point for $\mathbb{N}$. If we consider any $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ will contain an element of $\mathbb{N}$ (namely, $1$). If we consider the deleted neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(1)=(1-\varepsilon,1+\varepsilon)$, it is an interval, so it must contain an infinite amount of points. But in between any two real numbers ($1-\varepsilon$ and $1+\varepsilon$) there can only be a finite number of natural numbers. Thus there must be elements in the interval which are not in $\mathbb{N}$ and for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ contains an element of the natural numbers, and element not in the natural numbers, satisfying the definition of a boundary point.

Obviously $1\in \mathbb{N}$, so we have show that $1 \in \mathbb{N}\setminus \partial(\mathbb{N})$ and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}\setminus  \mathbb{N}'$. Thus the two sets are not equal and the statement has been disproven.

##### Exercise 3.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ closed and $T$ is open, then $S\cap T$ is not open.

This is false. Consider $S=[0,10]$ and $T=(2,6)$. $S\cap T=(2,6)$, which is open.

##### Exercise 3.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $T\setminus S$ is open.

We will disprove this statement. Let $T=[0,10]$ and $S=(4,6)$. $T\setminus S=[0,4]\cup [6,10]$, which is a closed set.

##### Exercise 3.29*
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $S\setminus T$ is open.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] if we can show for all elements $x \in \partial(S\setminus T)$, $x\notin S\setminus T$, then $S\setminus T$ must be open. $x \notin S\setminus T$ is equivalent to $x \in T \lor x \notin S$.

Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\partial(S\setminus T)$. We must show that $x \in T$, or $x$ is not in $S$ in order to prove that $S\setminus T$ is open. 

By the definition of a boundary point for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $y \in N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ such that $y \in R\setminus(S\setminus T)\Leftrightarrow y \in T \lor y \notin S$.

In the case where $y \notin S$, it is impossible for $x$ to be an interior point. Because $S$ is open, that means that $x \notin S$.
In the case where $y \in T$, we have that $x$ is an accumulation point. Because $T$ is closed, this implies $x \in T$.

Both of these outcomes are sufficient to guarantee that $S\setminus T$ is open.

##### Theorem 3.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $cl(S)=S \cup \partial(S)$.

First we will show that $cl(S)=S\cup S'\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$. Let $x$ be an element of $S\cup S'$. If $x \in S$ then it is clearly also in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Consider the case where $x \notin S$ and $x \in S'$. If we consider neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, it must include an element not in $S$ (namely, $x$), and because it is an accumulation point it must also contain an element *in* $S$. By definition this makes it an accumulation point. Thus every element of $S\cup S'$ is an element of $S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S\cup S'\subseteq S \cup \partial(S)$.

Now we must show that $S\cup \partial(S)\subseteq S\cup S'$. Consider a $y$ in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Again, if $y$ is in $S$ it obviously must be in $S\cup S'$. Consider the case where it is not and $y \in \partial(S)$ and $y \notin S$. Because $y$ is a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$. $y$ is not in $S$, so $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. By definition this makes $y \in S'$ and thus $y \in S\cup S'$.

Thus we have show that $cl(S)\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S \cup \partial(S) \subseteq cl(S)$, so they must be equal.

##### Exercise 3.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=(0,1)$ and let $F=\left\{  \left( 0,1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)|n \in \mathbb{N}  \right\}$. Is $F$ an open cover for $S$? Show that there is no finite subset of $F$ which also covers $S$.

We will prove that $F$ is indeed an open cover for $(0,1)$. 

If we consider any number $x \in (0,1)$, there will always exist an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}<1-x$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]]. Therefore $x<1-\frac{1}{n}$. We also know that $x>0$ (because $x \in (0,1)$), so $x \in \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By construction this means that $x$ is in one of the elements of $S$, and thus must be in the union of all of the elements of $F$. Because $x$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, this implies that $F$ is an open cover for $(0,1)$.

For any finite subset of $F$ which we will call $F'$, consider the set $S=\left\{  n \in \mathbb{N}|\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)\in F'  \right\}$. Because this set is finite we can select a maximal element which we will call $b$. Notice that for every $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$ if $x<y$ then $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{x} \right)\subseteq\left( 0,1-\frac{1}{y} \right)$. We selected $b$ as a maximal element of $S$, so for every interval in $F'$, it must be a subset of $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{b} \right)$. Thus if there is a number which is not in $\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$ it will not be in any element of $F'$.

Now consider the endpoint of that interval $1-\frac{1}{b}$. Because it is an open interval $1-\frac{1}{b}\notin \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$. $b$ is a natural number, so $\frac{1}{b}$ is less than one (in the case where $b=1$ the set would be empty), and greater than zero. Thus $0<1- \frac{1}{b}<1$, and $1- \frac{1}{b} \in (0,1)$. We have produced a number which is in $(0,1)$, but is not "covered" by $F$.

#### 4.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 4.1
> [!none] 
> A function $a:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ is called a sequence. When discussing a sequence, we will typically denote individual elements of the range using subscripts: $a_{i}:=a(1),a_{2}:=a(2)$, etc. We will then denote the entire sequence by $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$, or $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots)$, or simple just by $a_{n}$.

##### Example 4.2
> [!none] 
> The sequence $(n^{2})_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,4,9,16,\dots)$ is the sequence of each of the natural numbers squared. It is clear that the further we go in the sequence, the larger the sequence elements become.

##### Example 4.3
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \sin\left( \frac{\pi n}{2} \right) \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0)$ is a sequence that taeks on the values of $1,0,$ and $-1$ in a repeating pattern. It is clear that the pattern displayed in this sequence will continue forever.

##### Example 4.4
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \frac{n+5}{n} \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has its first few terms as 5,3,7/3,2,9/5,5/3,... It appears that the terms in this sequence are getting smaller; but it is unclear at first glance whether this trend continues. If we look out a bit into the sequence, we see that $a_{100}=\frac{105}{100}=1.05$, and if go really far we see that $a_{8745}\approx 1.00057$. So it seems like the "long-term" behavior of this sequence is to have sequence elements that "get close to" the number 1.

##### Definition 4.5
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to **converge to a number** $L$ if and only if $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$ then $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. In this case, we say that the $(a_{n})$ is a **convergent sequence** and that the number $L$ is a **limit** of the sequence ($a_{n}$).

##### Definition 4.6
> [!none] 
> A sequence ($a_{n}$) is said to **eventually** have a property $P$ if and only if there exists an $N$ such that, whenever $n>N$, $a_{n}$ has property $P$. In other words: ($a_{n}$) eventually has property $P$ if there exists an $N$ such that every term with index greater than $N$ has property $P$.

##### Exercise 4.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }$. Show that $a_{n}$ will eventually be greater than or equal to $10$. 

We will do this through proof by induction.

Base case: $a_{100}=10$.

Inductive hypothesis: $\sqrt{ n+x }$ is always greater than $\sqrt{ n }$ if $x>0$. Thus if if any $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }\geq10$, then $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{ n+1 }$ must be as well. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\geq100$, $a_{n}\leq10$ .

##### Theorem 4.8 (Uniqueness of Limits)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L$, and also converges to a number $M$. Then $L=M$.

$L=M$ if and only if $\left| L-M \right|<0$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. Suppose we choose an $N$ such that if $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $\left| a_{n}-M \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. By the triangle inequality
$$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-L-(a_{n}-M) \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\left| M-L \right| <\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$$

Thus $M$ must equal $L$.

##### Example 4.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$.
> 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\frac{1}{n}$ can be smaller than any real number. Consider $\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|=\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ we can produce an $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than it, so the limit must be 0.

##### Example 4.10
> [!none] 
> Use the definition of limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{2n+1}{3n+4}= \frac{2}{3}$.

This proof is not that hard, but very lengthy, so just refer to the books if you need to.

##### Exercise 4.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}=1$.

$\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}= \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 9|#Example 4 9]] we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{n}=0$, so our limit must equal 1.

##### Exercise 4.12
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Use the definition of limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{4n-5}{n+2}=4$.

This is essentially identical to [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 10|#Example 4 10]]. 
##### Exercise 4.13
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. What does it mean for a number $L$ to not a a limit of $a_{n}$?

If $L$ is a limit of $a_{n}$ that means
$$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists N \in\mathbb{N}|\forall n>N (\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon)
$$

For $L$ to not be a limit of $a_{n}$ we negate the definition to get
$$
\exists\varepsilon>0|\forall N \in\mathbb{N},\exists n>N|(\left| a_{n}-L \right| \geq\varepsilon )
$$

In words: There exists an $\varepsilon$ greater than zero such that for all $N$ in the natural numbers there will exists an $n$ greater than $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is not within a distance $\varepsilon$ of $L$.

##### Exercise 4.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,\dots)$ does not converge to the number 1.

Consider an $\varepsilon=0.5$. For any $N$ there will always be an $n$ such that $a_{n}=-1$ and $\left| a_{n}-1 \right|=2\geq0.5$. Thus the definition for not being a limit point as given in the previous exercise has been fulfilled and $1$ is not a limit of the sequence.

#### 4.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 4.15 (First Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $$
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B \text{ and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}-b_{n})=A-B.
> \end{align}
> $$

$(i)$
Let $\varepsilon>0$.
By definition of a limit
$$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall n>N_{1},\left| a_{n}-A \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall n>N_{2},\left| b_{n}-B \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\end{align}
$$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$. For all $n>N$
$$
\begin{align}
&\left| a_{n}+b_{n}-(A+B) \right|= \left| (a_{n}-A)+(b_{n}-B) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-A \right|+\left| b_{n}-B \right|  < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$$
The triangle allows the first line to be less than or equal to the second line.
By definition this means that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B$.

$(ii)$
Consider the sequence $-b_{n}$. We will show that its limit is $-B$. $\left| -b_{n}-(-B) \right|=\left| B-b_{n} \right|$ which we can make arbitrarily small cause $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$. Then we just use the previous result and add $a_{n}+(-b_{n})$, and their limits will add, meaning $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}-b_{n}=A-B)$

##### Theorem 4.16 (Second Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $$
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}\cdot b_{n})=A\cdot B \\
> &\text{ Also, if $B\neq0$, then $b_{n}\neq0$ for sufficiently large n and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \left( \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} \right)=\frac{A}{B}
> \end{align}
> $$

$(i)$
$$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}b_{n}-AB \right|&=\left| a_{n}b_{n}-Ab_{n}+Ab_{n}-AB \right|  \\
&= \left| b_{n}(a_{n}-A) +A(b_{n}-B)\right| \\
&\leq \left| b_{n} \right| \left| a_{n} -A\right|+\left| A \right| \left| b_{n}-B \right|   
\end{align}
$$

By definition of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ we can make $\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ and $\left| b_{n}-B \right|$ as small as we would like. Thus the only thing we need to show in order to make the expression less than $\varepsilon$ is to show that $b_{n}$ will be bounded, so we can make $\left| b_{n} \right|\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ as small as we would like. A much more fleshed out argument is given in the book.

$(ii)$
The crux of this proof is in the fact that
$$
\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right| =\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{B\cdot b_{n}} \right| 
$$
and we can make $B-b_{n}$ as small as we want, and $B\cdot b_{n}$ is bounded. Thus $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$, and then we can just think of this as the multiplication of two series.
##### Theorem 4.17 (Order Limit Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence that converges to a limit $A$. If $a_{n}\geq0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq0$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose that $A<0$. By definition of a limit we can produce an $a_{n}$ such that $\left| a_{n}-A \right|<\left| A \right|$. Because $a_{n}>A$ and $A<0$ this is equivalent to $a_{n}-A<-A$. But this would imply that $a_{n}$ is negative, giving us our contradiction.

##### Corollary 4.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ and $(b_{n})$ be sequences that converge to limits $A$ and $B$, respectfully. If $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq B$.

Consider the sequence $c_{n}=a_{n}-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B$. Because $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $a_{n}-b_{n}\leq0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B\geq0\to A\geq B$. 

##### Definition 4.19
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **bounded** if and only if $\exists B>0$ such that $\left| a_{n} \right|<B$, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, a sequence is bounded if there exists two number $B_{1},B_{2}$ such that $B_{1}<a_{n}<B_{2}$ for every sequence element $a_{n}$.

##### Definition 4.20
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **increasing** (resp. strictly increasing) if and only if $a_{n+1}>a_{n}$ ($a_{n+1}>a_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Similarly, a sequence $(b_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **decreasing** (strictly decreasing) if and only if $b_{n+1}\leq b_{n}$ ($b_{n+1}<b_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. A sequence is said to be **monotone** if and only if the sequence is increasing or is decreasing.

##### Theorem 4.21 (Monotone Convergence Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Every bounded monotone sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ converges.

We will prove that every bounded increasing sequence will converge, but the proof that every bounded decreasing sequence will converge is structured exactly the same.

Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ is bounded and increasing. Let $S=\{ a_{n}|n \in \mathbb{N} \}$, and $m=\text{ sup}(S)$ (we know that $\text{ sup}(S)$ exists because $S$ is bounded). We will use $m$ as a candidate limit for $a_{n}$. Let $\varepsilon>0$. There must exists an $x \in S$ such that $m-\varepsilon<x<m$, by the definition of a supremum. Because $x \in S$ that means $\exists l \in N|a_{l}=x$ and $m-\varepsilon<a_{l}<\varepsilon$. $a_{n}$ is increasing, so for every $n>l$, $m>a_{n}>a_{l}>m-\varepsilon$ ($a_{n}$ must be $<m$ because $m$ is the supremum). Therefore every element after $a_{l} \in N_{\varepsilon}(m)$, and thus $m$ must be the limit of the sequence.

#### 4.3 Follow Up Work

##### Exercise 4.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Develop complete proofs of all lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Lemma 4.23
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $b_{n}$ converges to a number $B\neq 0$. Then there exists a constant $\alpha>0$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ sufficiently large. (Here, we say that $b_{n}$ is eventually bounded away from zero.)

First we will show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N$, $b_{n}\in N_{B}(B)$. Let $n>N$.

If $B\geq0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{+}$ so every $b_{n}$ must be positive. If this is the case then $\left| b_{n} \right|=b_{n}$ and clearly the two must have the same limit $\left| B \right|=B$.
If $B<0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{-}$ and every $b_{n}$ must be negative. Thus $\left| b_{n} \right|=-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }-b_{n}=-B=\left| B \right|$. Thus is both cases $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$.

Using this fact let we know that $0<\left| B \right|=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|$. Let $\alpha$ be a real number such that $0<\alpha<\left| B \right|$. We can now produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N, \left| b_{n} \right|\in N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(\left| B \right|)$. Every element in $N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(B)$ is greater than $\alpha$, so we $N$ is the number we were seeking to produce and we are done.

##### Exercise 4.24*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove part $(ii)$ of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]]

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed number.

Because $B\neq0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 23|#Lemma 4 23]] there exists an $\alpha$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ greater than some $N_{1}\in\mathbb{N}$. It then follows that $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}} \right|< \frac{1}{\alpha}$.
Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there exists an $N_{2}$ such that $\forall n >N_{2}$
$$
\left| b_{n}-B \right|<\left| B\alpha \right|\cdot \varepsilon  
$$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$ and suppose that $n>N$.
$$
\begin{align}
&\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}  -\frac{1}{B} \right|=\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{Bb_{n}} \right| =\left| \frac{1}{Bb_{n}} \right|\left| B-b_{n} \right|    \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha} \right| \left| B-b_{n} \right|  \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha } \right| \left| B\alpha \cdot \varepsilon  \right| =\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$$
Therefore for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists an $N$ such that $\forall n >N$, $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right|<\varepsilon$ and thus by definition $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$. We know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$, so using part $(i)$. of the Second Algebraic Limit Theorem we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\cdot \frac{1}{b_{n}}=A/B$.

##### Theorem 4.25 (The Squeeze Theorem for Sequences)*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$, and $c_{n}$ are three sequences, and suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}$. If $a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}$ for all $n$ sufficiently large, then $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L.$

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

By the definition of a limit
$$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall  n >N_{1},\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall  n >N_{2},\left| b_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\end{align}
$$
Let $n>max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$
$$
\begin{align}
\left| L-a_{n} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
L-a_{n}&<\varepsilon \\
a_{n}&>L-\varepsilon \\
\left| b_{n}-L \right| &<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}-L&<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}&<\varepsilon+L
\end{align}
$$
Therefore
$$
\displaylines{
L-\varepsilon<a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}<\varepsilon+L\\
-\varepsilon<c_{n}-L<\varepsilon
}
$$
Thus $\left| c_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$, and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L$.

##### Exercise 4.26
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Show that if $a_{n}$ converges to a limit $L$, then $a_{n}$ is bounded.

Choose a specific $\varepsilon>0$. By the definition of a limit $\exists N$ such that $\forall n>N, a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Thus every term after $a_{N}$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon+L$ and bounded below by $L-\varepsilon$. If we look at the sequence $a_{1-(N-1)}$, it is finite, so it must have an upper bound $M_{1}$ and a lower bound $B_{1}$. If we let $M=max\{ M_{1},\varepsilon+L \}$ and $B=\{ B_{1},L-\varepsilon \}$ then $M$ and $B$ will bound the whole sequence.

##### Defintion 4.27
> [!none] 
> We say that a sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is **in a set** $S$ if and only if $a_{n} \in S$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

##### Lemma 4.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ is a sequence in $S$, and suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L.$ Then $L \in S\cup S'$.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. 

Case 1: $L \in S$. We are done.

Case 2: $L\notin S$. We must show that $L \in S'$.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By the definition of a limit, $\exists N$ such that for all $n>N$ $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Suppose that every sequence element $a_{n}=L$. This would mean that the limit $L$ would equal $a_{n}$, which is an element of $S$, giving a contradiction. So there must be at least one $a_{i}$ where $i\geq n$ and $a_{i} \neq L$. Thus $a_{i}\in N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(L)$ and we have satisfied the definition of an accumulation point for $L$.

##### Lemma 4.29*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ be a set. If $x \in S'$, then there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ that satisfies $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

By the definition of an accumulation point $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ is nonempty for all $\varepsilon>0$. Notice that this set is equivalent to $N_{\varepsilon}(x)\cap S\setminus \{ x \}$. Thus for any epsilon we can produce a $y \in S\setminus \{ x \}$ in that epsilon neighborhood. Thus
$$
\begin{align}
&\exists y_{1}|y_{1} \in N_{1}(x) \\
&\exists y_{2}|y_{2} \in N_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) \\
&\exists y_{3}|y_{3} \in N_{\frac{1}{3}}(x) \\
&\vdots\\
&\exists y_{n}|y_{n} \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x) \\
\end{align}
$$
Where every $y_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (Notice that every $y_{n}$ does not have to be distinct; the function will just not be 1-1).

Now consider the sequence $a_{n}=y_{n}$. Because every $y_{n} \in S\setminus \{ x \}$, $a_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$. We now have to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. 

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|Theorem 1.3]] we can produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<\varepsilon$. Consider any $a_{m}$ such that $m>N$. $a_{m} \in N_{\frac{1}{m}}(x)\subseteq N_{\frac{1}{N}}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}$. Thus for every $m>N$ $\left| a_{m}-x \right|<\varepsilon$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

##### Corollary 4.30

> - [x]  Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $p \in cl(T)$ if and only if there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $T$ such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} = p$.

First we will show the forward direction: If $p \in cl(T)$ then there exists a sequence such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$. [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] guarantees that if $p \in S'$ then we can produce such a sequence. Thus we only have to consider the case where $p \in S$, which is trivial because obviously the sequence $a_{n}=p,\forall n \in N$ converges to $p$.

[[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] Proves the backward direction.

##### Theorem 4.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

Forward direction: If $S$ is closed, then every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] if $a_{n}$ converges, it must converge to an element in $S\cup S'=cl(S)$, but because $S$ is closed $cl(S)=S$, and thus $a_{n}$ must converge to an element in $S$.

Backward direction: If every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\in S$, then $S$ is closed.

Let $x \in S'$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (and thus also in $S$), such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. By our assumption this means that $x \in S$. Thus we have proved that $S'\subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed.

##### Definition 4.32
> [!none] 
> A sequence $b_{n}$ is said to **diverge to** infinity (denoted $\lim\limits_{ b_{n} \to \infty }=\infty$) if and only if $\forall P>0,\exists M>0$ such that if $n\geq M$ then $b_{n}>P$. Similarly, a sequence $c_{n}$ is said to diverge to negative infinity if and only if $\forall P<0,\exists M>0$ such that if $n\geq M$, then $c_{n}<P$.

##### Exercise 4.33
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(\sqrt{ n })$ diverges to $\infty$.

Let $P>0$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there exists an $N$ such that $N>P^{2}\to \sqrt{ N }>P$. Thus for all $n\geq N$, $\sqrt{ n }>P$, and $\sqrt{ n }$ diverges to $\infty$.

##### Exercise 4.34*
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Suppose $a_{n}$ is a sequence of positive numbers that converges to a number $L$. Then, for any positive integer $m$, the sequence of roots $(\sqrt[m]{ a_{n} })_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\sqrt[m]{ L }$.

##### Exercise 4.35
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Suppose that $a_{1}=1$ and that $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{ 20+a_{n} }$. Show that $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges, and find its limit.

##### Exercise 4.36
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  This exercise is really long and I don't want to write it out. Look at it in the book.

##### Exercise 4.37
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Let $a_{n}(x):=\cos(nx)$. (We can interpret this so that for each fixed $x$, the sequence $a_{n}(x)$ is a sequence.) Clearly, $(a_{n}(0))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges and $(a_{n}(2\pi))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges. Prove that the sequence $(a_{n}(x))$ diverges if $x \in (0,2\pi)$.

The books skeleton is pretty much the entire proof. Refer there.

##### Exercise 4.38

> - [ ]  Again, this is too long to write out. Refer to the textbook.

### Chapter 5

#### 5.1 Preliminary Work

##### Defintion 5.1
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **Cauchy** if and only if for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $M>0$ such that $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ for all integers $n,m\geq M$.

##### Exercise 5.2
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$ is a Cauchy sequence.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we can produce an $M>0$ such that for all $n>M$ $\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|<\varepsilon$. Let $m>M$ as well. Because $\frac{1}{m}$ is positive and less than $\frac{1}{n}$, $\left| \frac{1}{n} -\frac{1}{m}\right|<\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|<\varepsilon$. Thus $\frac{1}{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L \in \mathbb{R}$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

Let $M$ be a number such that for $\forall n>M$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, and suppose that $n$ and $m$ are both greater than $M$.

$$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| &=\left| (a_{n}-L)+(L-a_{m}) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-L \right| +\left| L-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$$

Thus for any $n,m>M$, $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ and so $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If a sequence is Cauchy, then it is bounded

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

There exists an $M>0$ such that for all $n,m>M$
$$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon  
\end{align}
$$
Let $n$ be fixed and set $a_{n}=A$.
$$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{m}-A \right| &<\varepsilon  \\
a_{m}-A&<\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&<\varepsilon+A \\
\left| A-a_{m} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
A-a_{m}&<\varepsilon \\ 
a_{m}-A&>-\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&>A-\varepsilon
\end{align}
$$

Thus $A-\varepsilon$ is a lower bound and $A+\varepsilon$ is an upper bound for every element after $a_{M}$. The sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{M}$ is finite and thus must be bounded above by some number $B$ and bounded below by $-B$. Thus $min\{ A-\varepsilon,-B \}$ must be a lower bound for the whole sequence, and $max\{ A+\varepsilon,B \}$ must be an upper bound for the whole sequence.

##### Definition 5.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is called a **subsequence** of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$. If a subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L_{1}$ then we say that $L_{1}$ is a **subsequential limit** of the original sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$.

##### Exercise 5.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})=\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$. Explain why $\left( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots \right)$ is a subsequence of $(a_{n})$, but $\left( 1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{4},\dots \right)$ is not.

In the first case the subsequence is strictly increasing (the denominators are always going up), while in the second case it is not.

##### Exercise 5.8
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence, where $a_{n}$ is defined to be $\frac{1}{n}$ if $n$ is even, and $\frac{n}{n+4}$ if $n$ is odd.
> 1. Write out the first eight terms of this sequence.
> 2. Let $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2k)_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2,4,8,\dots)$. Write out the first few terms of the subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})$. What is your conjecture for the value of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{m_{k}}$?
> 3. Let $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2k-1)_{k=1}^{\infty}=(1,3,5,7,\dots)$. Write out the first few terms of the subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})$. What is your conjecture for the value of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{m_{k}}$?

1. $$(a_{n})_{n=1}^{8}= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{7}{11}, \frac{1}{8}$$
2. $$(a_{2k})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{6},\dots$$ This seems like it will approach 0.
3. $$(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{7}{11},\dots$$ This seems to be approaching $\frac{1}{2}$.

##### Lemma 5.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $m_{k}\geq k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by induction.

Base case: $k=1$. if $m_{k}$ is in the natural numbers then it must be $\geq1=k$. Thus the base case is verified.

Induction hypothesis: Assume that for some natural number $k$, $m_{k}\geq k$. We must then show that $m_{k+1}\geq k+1$. This is very straightforward to verify because $m_{k}$ is strictly increasing.

#### 5.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 5.10
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ and $l \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$ if and only if all subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$.

Forward direction: If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$, then all of the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ as well.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value. There must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$. Every $a_{m_{k}}$ where $m_{k}>N$ must be within this epsilon range as well, making it convergent.

Backward direction: If all the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must as well.
This proof is trivial, because $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a subsequence of itself.

##### Theorem 5.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence and let $b_{k}:=a_{2k}$ and $c_{k}:=a_{2k+1}$. Show that $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L$ if and only if both $(b_{k})$ and $(c_{k})$ converges to $L$.

This is just applying the theorem above?

##### Lemma 5.12 (Monotone Subsequence Lemma)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a monotone subsequence.

Let $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. We will call a term $a_{M}$ a **dominant term** if and only if $a_{M}>a_{n}$ for all $n>M$.

There must either be a finite amount of dominant terms for $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or an or an infinite amount.

If there is an infinite number of dominant terms, then the subsequence $\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ of dominant terms will be decreasing by definition of a dominant term.

If there is a finite amount of dominant terms there must exists a greatest dominant term (greatest not in value, but in its placement in the sequence), $a_{N}$. Thus for all $n>N$, $a_{n}$ cannot be a dominant term. By negating the definition of a dominant term, we get the following fact:

> [!none] 
> For every $n>N$  there must exists an $m>n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_{m}\geq a_{n}$.

Thus
$$
\begin{align}
&\exists m_{1}>N+1:a_{m_{1}}\geq a_{N+1}\\
&\exists m_{2}>m_{1}:a_{m_{2}}\geq a_{m_{1}}\\
&\exists m_{3}>m_{1}:a_{m_{3}}\geq a_{m_{2}}\\
&\vdots\\
&\exists m_{k}>m_{k-1}:a_{m_{k}}\geq a_{m_{k-1}}\\
\end{align}
$$
Thus if we set $\{ a_{n_{k}} \}=\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ by construction the sequence will be increasing and thus monotone.

In both the case where there are a finite number of dominant terms, and in the case where there is an infinite number, we can produce a monotone sequence.

##### Theorem 5.13 (Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence.

Combining the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem|#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem]] with [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma|#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma]] gives us the desired result.

##### Lemma 5.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})$ has a convergent subsequence, then $a_{n}$ must converge.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value and $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a convergent subsequence within $(a_{n})$.
$$
\exists N_{1}|\forall k>N_{1}  \left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$$
$$
\exists N_{2}\forall n,m>N\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$$

Let $k>N_{1}$ and $n,m>N_{2}$.
$$
\left| a_{n}-L \right| \leq \left| a_{n}-a_{m_{k}} \right| +\left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon.
$$

##### Theorem 5.15 (Cauchy Criterion)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

1. Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. (Easy to prove the same way we did for convergent sequences in [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 4 26|#Exercise 4 26]]).
2. Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences]])
3. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence.
4. Every Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges ([[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 14|#Lemma 5 14]]).
5. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

Pick a $\delta>0$ such that $\frac{1}{\delta}=\epsilon$. The AP gives that for some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose the hypotheses are true, but the conclusion is false.

Consider the set $S:=\{ n\in\mathbb{N}|P(n) \text{ is false} \}$. By our initial assumption this set cannot be empty. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well-Ordering Principle for mathbb N|Well-Ordering Principle]] this set has a least element $l$. $P(l-1)$ must be true, otherwise $l-1$ would be in the set, and $l$ would not be the least element. But if $l-1$ is true, then by our first assumption, $P(l-1+1)=P(l)$ must be true. Therefore $P(l)$ is must true, and false (because it is in $S$), giving us our contradiction.

##### Definition 1.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are nonempty sets. Then $A$ is said to be **equinumerous** with $B$ iff there exists a bijection $f:A\to B$. In this case we write $A \sim B$ and say that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality.

##### Definition 1.7
> [!none]
> A set $S$ is said to be **finite** if and only if $S=\emptyset$ or $S \sim \{ 1,\dots ,n\}$, we say that $S$ is **finite with** $n$ **elements** and write $\left| S \right|=n$, where $\left| S \right|$ is referred to as the number of elements in the finite set $S$.

##### Exercise 1.8
> [!none] 
> - [x] Explicity show that the set $\{ North, East, South, West \}$ and the set $\{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ are equinumerous in the sense of [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 7|Definition 1.7]] (i.e., by constructing a bijection between the two sets). Do these sets satisfy definition 1.7 for some $n$?

Consider the function $f:\{ North, East, South, West \} \to \{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ s.t.
$
\begin{align}
f(North) &= 1 \\
f(East) &= 4 \\
f(South) &= 7 \\
f(West) &= 10
\end{align}
$
It is trivial to show that $f$ is a 1-1 and onto, and that both sets are equinumerous to the set $\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$.

##### Definition 1.9
> [!none] 
> Let $S$ be a set. Then the **power set of** $S$, denoted $P(S)$ is the set that contains all subsets of $S$.

##### Example 1.10
> [!none] 
> Consider the set $S=\{ 1,2 \}$ with two elements in it. Its power set, $P(S)=\{ \emptyset,\{ 1 \},\{ 2 \},\{ 1,2 \} \}$, is a set with four elements in it

##### Theorem 1.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let  $S$ be a set with $n$ elements in it. Then $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements in it.

If $S$ has one element in it $P(S)=S$, both of which have 1 element in them. When you add an element to any set, the new power set will be the old power set, plus every set in the old power set plus the new element. Thus every time we add a new element we double the elements in the power set. It is easy to show that these two facts, when combined, imply that $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements when $S$ has $n$ elements.

Alternatively, to construct any set we could iterate through every element of the set and either put it in the set, or not. This results in $2^{n}$ different ways we could construct the sets.

##### Definition 1.12
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **countably infinite** (or **denumerable**) if and only if $S \sim \mathbb{N}$. A set $S$ is said to be **countable** if and only if $S$ is finite or countably infinite.

##### Exercise 1.13
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Show that $2\mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{N}$ by identifying a bijection between them.

Consider the function $f:2\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(e) = \frac{e}{2}
\end{align}
$
for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ $f(2n)$ will map to $n$, ensuring that the function is onto. If $f(m)=f(n)$ then $2n=2m$, which implies $n=m$, showing that the function is also 1-1, and thus a bijection.

##### Theorem 1.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The sets $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality (or, put another way: $\mathbb{Z}$ is countably infinite).

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(n)&=\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)\qquad n \text{ is even} \\
f(n)&=-\frac{n-1}{2}\qquad n \text{ is odd}
\end{align}
$
For any positive integer $x$, $f(2x)$ will map to it ($2x$ is guaranteed to be a natural number). For any negative (or = 0) integer $y$, $f(-2y +1)$ will map to $y$. Therefore $f$ is onto.

Suppose $f(m)=f(n)$. WLG, if $m$ is odd, and $n$ is even, then we have:
$
\begin{align}
\frac{n}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
n&= -m+1 \\
n+m&= 1
\end{align}
$
But if both $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers their sum must be greater than $1$. Therefore one cannot be even and the other odd.

It's trivial to show the following equations are only true when $n=m$.
$
\begin{align}
-\frac{n-1}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
\frac{n}{2}&=\frac{m}{2}
\end{align}
$
Thus $f$ is 1-1 as well, making it a bijection.

#### 1.2 Main Theorems

##### Composition of Two Bijections Lemma
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ are bijections, then the composite function $f \circ g:A\to C$ will be a bijection as well.

This is a fact will be useful in multiple of the following proofs.

First we will prove that for bijections $f:X\to S$ and $g:S\to V$, $g\circ f:X \to V$ is a bijection as well. 

For every element $v\in V$ there exists an element in $x \in X$ such that maps to it (by the definition of $f$ being onto). For every $x$ there is an element $s \in S$ which maps to it, because $g$ is onto. Thus there exists an $s \in S$ that will map to any $v \in V$, so $g \circ f$ in onto.

Next, we must show that $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well.

If $g(f(n))=g(f(m))$ then because $g$ is 1-1, $f(n)=f(m)$. Because $f$ is 1-1 as well that implies $n=m$, so $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well as onto.



##### Theorem 1.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable

If $S\in\mathbb{N}$ is finite, then it is countable by definition.

The meat of the proof lies in proving that $S$ is countable when it is infinite. 

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to S$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(1) &= min(S) \\
f(2) &= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1) \}) \\
\vdots \\
f(n)&=min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(n-1) \})
\end{align}
$

We know that such minimum elements must exist because of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|well ordering principle]]. Our job is now to show that this function is both 1-1 and onto.

Consider the the following set where $x \in S$
$
S_{x}:=\{ y \in S|y\leq x \} 
$

Because this set is bounded below (Well Ordering Principle), and above (by x), it is finite, and thus has a cardinality.

For any $x \in S$ consider $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)$. The cardinality of $S_{x}$ is 1+ the number of elements less than $x$ in $S$ (the +1 is because $x$ is included in the set as well). Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|) = min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots f(\left| S_{x}-1 \right|) \})$ take the least element of the set $S$ with all the elements less than $x$ removed. Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)=x$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $x \in S$, $f$ is onto.

We will argue that $f$ is 1-1 by contradiction. If $f$ were not 1-1, then there exists an $n$ and $m$ such that $f(n)=f(m)$ and $n\neq m$. That implies that WLOG, $n<m$. $f(m)= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \})$. Because $n<m$ $f(n)$ must not be in the set $S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \}$. $f(m)$ must in in this set, because it is the least element of it. But $f(m)=f(n)$, so $f(n)$ is in this set. Thus we have our contradiction, showing that $f$ is 1-1.

Therefore, $f$ is 1-1 and onto, making it a bijection, and making the set $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every subset of a countable set is countable.

Suppose $X\subseteq S$ where $S$ is a countable set.
If a set $S$ is countable, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $\mathbb{N}\to S$. Consider the sets $\mathbb{N}':=\{ n \in \mathbb{N}|f(n) \in X \}$. If we use the same function $f$, but change the domain and codomain such that it goes from $\mathbb{N}'\to S$, it is not difficult to see that it is a bijection.

By construction the function is onto, and we already know that it is 1-1. Therefore there $f$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}'$ to $X$. But $\mathbb{N}'$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|Theorem 1.15]] $X$ must be countable as well.

##### Theorem 1.17
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $F$ is a collection of nonempty sets, then the equinumerous relation $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation on $F$.

To show that $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation we must show that it is reflexive ($A\sim A$), symmetric (if$A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$), and transitive (if $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$).

1. Reflexive—If we consider the function $f:A\to A$ for all $a\in A$ such that $f(a)= a$, checking that it is onto and 1-1 is trivial.
2. Symmetry—If $A\sim B$ then there exists a bijection $f$ from $A\to B$ for all $a\in A$, and $b\in B$. The inverse of a bijection is still a bijection, it is easy to verify that $f^{-1}$ is a bijection from $B\to A$. Thus implying that $B\sim A$.
3. Transitive—If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$ then there exists bijections $f$ and $g$ from $A\to B$ and from $B\to C$ respectively. Once again, it is straightforward to verify that the function $f \circ g$ is a bijection from $A \to C$, implying that $A \sim C$.

##### Theorem 1.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. If there exists an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:\mathbb{N} \to T$, then $T$ is countable.

Thus we have a bijection from $S$ to $f(S)$, which is a subset of of $N$. Thus 
First, we will consider the case where there is an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$. $f$ is already 1-1, and if we change the codomain to $f(S)$, then by definition it is onto as well. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|#Theorem 1 15]] because $f(S) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, $f(S)$ is countable. If $f(S)$ is finite it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite as well, and thus countable. If $f(S)$ is not countable then there is a bijection from $f(s)\to \mathbb{N}$.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because we have bijections from $S\to f(S)$ and from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$, there also exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, making $S$ countable.

Now we consider the case where there is a surjection $g:\mathbb{N}\to T$. Consider the class of sets $X_{t}:=\{ n \in\mathbb{N}|g(n)=t \}$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] $X_{t}$ will always have a least element. Thus we construct the set $N:=\{t\in T|min({ X_{t} })\}$. 

If we consider the same $g$, but tweak the domain to $N$ instead of $\mathbb{N}$, it will now be 1-1, because the least element of a set is unique. Thus it is both 1-1 and onto, giving a bijection from $N\to T$. Because $N \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ there is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to N$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because there are bijections from $\mathbb{N} \to N$ and from $N\to T$ there must also be a bijection from $N\to T$, making $T$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets with $T$ countable. If there exists an injection $f:S\to T$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:T\to S$, then $S$ is countable.

Consider the function $\hat{f}:S\to f(S)$ where the only difference between $f$ and $\hat{f}$ is their codomain. $\hat{f}$ is a bijection, and because $f(S)\subseteq T$, it must be countable ([[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]]). If $f(S)$ is finite, then it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite (and thus countable) as well. If $f(S)$ is not finite, then there exists a bijection between $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. Thus there is a bijection from $S\to f(S)$ as well as from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, thus making $S$ countable.

Consider the set $X_{s}:=\{t\in T|g(t)=s\}$. Now we construct the set $T':=\{min(X_{s})|s \in S\}$. Because the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] guarantees that there is only one least element, the function $\hat{g}:T'\to S$ is 1-1 as well as onto, making it a bijection. $T'\subseteq T$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]] $T'$ is countable. We now have a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to T'$ and from $T'\to S$. Thus by the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, making $S$ countable.

##### Lemma 1.20
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so are $A\cup  B$ and $A \times B$.

First we will prove that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $A$ and $B$ are countable there exists bijection $f$ and $g$ such that any element in $A$ or $B$ can be represented as
$
\displaylines{
a_{n}=f(n)\\
b_{n}=g(n)
}
$
Let's create a new function $h:\mathbb{N}\to A\cup B$
$
\begin{align}
h(n)&=a_{\frac{n}{2}}\qquad \text{n is even} \\
h(n)&=b_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\qquad \text{ n is odd}
\end{align}
$
By theorem [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 18|#Theorem 1 18]] we only must show that $h$ is onto in order to show that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $f$ and $g$ are countable we know any element in set $A$ can be represented as $a_{n}$ and any element in set $B$ can be represented as $b_{n}$. Thus any element of $A\cup B$ can be represented as either $a_{n}$ or $b_{n}$.

For an arbitrary $b_{n}$, $h(2n-1)$ will map to $b_{n}$. For an arbitrary $a_{n}$, $h(2n)$ will map to $a_{n}$. Thus the function is onto and we have proved that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Next we must prove that $A\times B$ is countable as well. We will again use the countability of $A$ and $B$ to represent an arbitrary element of them as $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ respectively.

I don't want to write out the whole rest of the proof, but the following picture should give a good idea that there is a bijection from $N\to A\cup B$.
![[IMG_F59FD7C26875-1.jpeg|IMG_F59FD7C26875-1.jpeg]]
Where $f(1)$ would be the first element hit by the purple arrow, $f(2)$ the second, and so on.

##### Theorem 1.21
> [!none] 
> - [>]  $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

To prove this we will invoke [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]] to say that $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is countable. Consider the function $f:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{N}^{2}$
$
f(q)=(a,b)\qquad \text{ Where a/b=q and is in lowest form}
$

If we show this function to be injective, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 19|#Corollary 1 19]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

Suppose there exists an two rational numbers such that where $q_{1}=\frac{a}{b}\neq \frac{x}{y}=q_{2}$, but $(a,b)=(x,y)$. The second statement, by definition, means that $a=x$ and $b=y$. but if that is true, then $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{x}{y}$ thus we have contradiction, meaning $f$ must be injective, and $\mathbb{Q}$ must be countable.

##### Theorem 1.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable

This proof is really beefy and I don't want to write it down. The skeleton in the book is very thorough and filling in the gaps should not be difficult.

##### Definition 1.23
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **uncountable** if and only if it is fails to satisfy [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 12|#Definition 1 12]]

In other words, for some set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is no bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, and the set is not finite.

##### Definition 1.24
> [!none] 
> If $p$ is an upper bound for a set $S$ and $p \in S$ then we say $p$ is a maximum element of $S$ (denoted $p=max(S)$). The definition for a minimum element is constructed similarly.

##### Definition 1.26
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above. A number $\alpha$ is a least upper bound for $S$ if and only if
> 1. $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $S$ and
> 2. if $y<\alpha$, then there exists some $x \in S$ such that $y<x\leq \alpha$.

Alternatively, for some number $\alpha$ to be the least upper bound for a set, then it must be both greater than or equal to every element in the set, and less than or equal to every other upper bound for $S$.

##### Exercise 1.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=\left\{  0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \dots \right\}$. Is $10$ an upper bound of $S$? Is $2$ an upper bound? What is the least upper bound for $S$? Does $S$ have a maximum element?

For all $n \in N$
$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n}&>0\\
-\frac{1}{n}&<0 \\
1-\frac{1}{n}&<1<10
\end{align}
$
Therefore $10$ is an upper bound for $S$. By the same argument $2$ is as well.

In the last step we showed that $1-\frac{1}{n}<1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $1$ is an upper bound for $S$. Consider any number $y<1$. by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\exists m \in \mathbb{N}| \frac{1}{m}<1-y$. Thus from rearranging that inequality we get
$
y<1-\frac{1}{m}
$
Because $m$ is a natural number, the term on the right will be an element of the set. Thus we have shown that for any $y<1$ there exists a number $>y$ and less than $1$ in $S$. Thus by the definition of a supremum $1$ is the least upper bound of $S$.

##### Lemma 1.28
> [!none] 
> If a nonempty set in $S$ has a least upper bound, then that least upper bound is unique. In other words, $S$ cannot have two different least upper bounds.

Suppose we have two numbers $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ that are least upper bounds for a set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We will argue that they must be the same number by contradiction. If they were not, then WLOG $x<y$. But $x$ is an upper bound, so $y$ cannot be the least upper bound if $x$ is less than it. Thus we have our contradiction and every least upper bound is unique.

##### Definition 1.29

##### Axiom 1.30 (The Axiom of Completeness)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$. Equivalently: Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 1.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Why are the two statements of the Axiom of Completeness equivalent?

For some some $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded blow, consider the set $B:=\{b \in \mathbb{R}|\forall x \in S, b\leq x\}$. This set is bounded above by every element of $S$, so the Axiom of Completeness says $m=\text{ sup}(B)$ must exists. Because every element in $S$ is an upper bound for $B$, $m\leq S$. Because $B$ is the set of upper bounds for $S$, by definition of a least upper bound, $m>$ every bound for $S$. Thus is satisfies both the criteria to be greatest lower bound for $S$.

The exact same process can be carried out to show that if we assume a set bounded below has a greatest lower bound, then any set must have a greatest upper bound. Thus the two formulations of the Axiom of Completeness are the same.

##### Exercise 1.35
> [!none] 
> Prove or disprove: $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite

In this proof we will rely on the results of [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 22|#Theorem 1 22]], [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 21|#Theorem 1 21]], and [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]], which state, respectively, that
1. $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable,
2. $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, and
3. The union of two countable sets is countable as well.

We will prove that $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is not countable by contradiction. Assume that it is countable. Now consider the set $\mathbb{Q}\cup \mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$. Because both of these sets are countable, their union must be as well. But we know what their union is; by definition it must be $\mathbb{R}$, which is uncountable. Thus we have our contradiction and the irrationals must be uncountable.

4. Yes it is. For any natural number $n$, $0=0$ and $\frac{1}{n+1}< \frac{1}{n}$

##### Theorem 1.39 (The Nested Interval Property)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $\{ I_{n} \}$ is a collection of nested, nonempty intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{R}$. Then the collection $\{ I_{n} \}$ has a nonempty intersection—in other words, there exists $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p$ is an element of $I_{n}$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

Consider the set $A:=\{n \in \mathbb{N}| a_{n} \}$. We know that $b_{1}$ is an upper bound on this set, because for any $a_{n}$, $b_{n}$ is greater than it, and $b_{1}<b_{n}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}>1$. Thus we can invoke the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness|#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness]] and say that $a=\text{ sup}(A)$ exists.

By the definition of a supremum, $a\geq a_{n}$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$a$ must also be less than or equal to every $b_{n}$. To show this fact we must first prove that any $b_{k}$ is greater than $a_{i}$ $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. If this were not the case, and there were some $a_{i}$ such that $a_{i}>b_{k}$, then there must also be an $b_{i}$ such that $b_{i}>a_{i}$. But this would mean that all elements in the $i$th interval are greater than all elements in the $k$th interval, so neither could be a subset of the other. Thus every $b_{n}$ must be greater than every $a_{i}$. Using this fact, if $a>b_{k}$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then there would be another upper bound, $b_{k}$, which is less than $a$, contradicting the definition of a supremum.

Therefore
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n}\qquad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
$
By construction thus must mean that $a$ is in every interval $I_{n}$.

##### Exercise 1.40
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Note that the hypothesis in the statement of the Nested Interval Property includes the assumption that each interval looks like $[a_{n},b_{n}]$. Would the theorem be hold for other types of nonempty intervals?

Nothing would change in our argument until the last line. 
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n} \qquad \forall  n \in \mathbb{N}
$

But this only implies that $a$ must be in the set $[a_{n}, b_{n}]$ *because the endpoints are included*. If instead it was in the form $(a_{n},b_{n}]$, or $(a_{n},b_{n})$, then we could have $a=a_{n}$, which would satisfy the inequality above, but not be included in those sets.

Consider the intervals $I_{n}=$ $\left( 0, \frac{1}{n} \right]$. For any number there will always be a $\frac{1}{n}$ smaller than it ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]]), so there will be a set it is not included in. This is only possible because the supremum of the left endpoints = 0, and because they are open intervals $0$ is not included in any of them.

##### Example 1.41
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ represent the trunction of $\pi$to $n$ decimal places, and let $b_{n}=a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}$. Then define $J_{n}=[a_{n},b_{n}]$. It follows that

> Show that $J_{1}\subseteq J_{2}\subseteq J_{3}\dots$ Now define $I_{n}=J_{n}\cap \mathbb{Q}$. In a world consisting of only rational numbers, $\{ I_{n} \}$ constitutes a collection of nonempty, nested intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{Q}$. Does it follow that there is some number $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p$ is an element in **every** $I_{n}$?

For any natural number $n$, $\frac{1}{10^{n}}>0$, so $a_{n}<b_{n}$. $a_{n+1}$ must be greater than $a_{n}$ (or, if the next decimal is 0, equal to $a_{n}$), because it is just $a_{n}$ plus the next decimal. $b_{n+1}=a_{n+1}+\frac{1}{10^{n+1}}<a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}=b_{n}$. Therefore each successive interval must be a subset of the last.

No, it does not imply that there will be a rational number $p$ that is in the intersection of every one of these sets. The Nested Interval Property only implies that there will be a **real number** such that it is in the intersection of all of the sets.

##### Exercise 1.50*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number.

We must show that for any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ where $a<b$ there exists a rational number $q$ such that $a<q<b$.

First, consider the case where $0\leq a<b$.

From [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we know that there exists a $n \in \mathbb{N}|$ $0<\frac{1}{n} < \left| b-a \right|$. Let $q=\frac{1}{n}$, where $q$ is clearly rational.

Consider the set $S=\{n \in \mathbb{N}|b\leq n\cdot q\}$. Because $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] allows us to produce an $m =min(S)$. $m-1$ must not be in $S$, otherwise $m$ would not be the least element of $S$ (we are guaranteed that it is in the naturals because $q<b$, so 1 cannot be the least element, thus $m-1\geq1$). By the construction of $S$ this implies that $(m-1)\cdot q <b$. 

$m$ must be in $S$, by the definition of a least element. This implies $mq\geq  b$.
$
\begin{align}
mq&\geq b \\
mq-q&\geq b-q>b-(b-a) \qquad \text{because }q<b-a\\ 
(m-1)q&>a
\end{align}
$
Therefore we have $a<(m-1)q<b$. Because $q$ is rational and $m-1$ is a natural number, $(m-1)q$ must be rational as well, and we have thus proved for any $0\leq a<b$ there is a rational number in between $a$ and $b$.

The case where $a<0<b$ is trivial because by construction $0$ a rational number within the interval.

Lastly we consider the case where $a<b\leq0$. Consider the interval between $-b$ and $-a$. Because $a,b$ are negative, $-a,-b$ must be positive and so we can use our previous work to produce a number $q \in Q|-b<q<-a$. negating this inequality produces $a<-q<b$, which is the desired result.

Thus for any $a$ and $b$ there will always be a rational number in between them.

##### Exercise 1.51*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $a<b$, then the open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] each of them will produce a unique rational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of rationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Corollary 1.52*
> [!none] 
> - [x] Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one irrational number.

We will prove this statement by contradiction. Assume it is false, and there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that in between them there are **no** irrational numbers. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there exists a $b \in \mathbb{Q}|a<q<b$. Consider an arbitrary $x \in (a-q,b-q)$.
$
\begin{align}
a-q&<x<b-q \\
a&<x+q<b
\end{align}
$
Therefore $x+q \in (a,b)$ and by our initial assumption $x+q$ is rational. But $q$ is rational, so $(x+q)-q=x$ must be rational as well. Thus all elements in the set $(a-q,b-q)$ are rational. From now on let $a'=a-q$ and $b'=b-q$.

Now consider the interval $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$, for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $s \in (n\cdot a', n\cdot b')$
$
\begin{align}
n\cdot a' < s < n\cdot b' \\
a'< \frac{s}{n}<b'
\end{align}
$
Therefore $\frac{s}{n} \in (a',b')$ and is rational. But if $\frac{s}{n}$ is rational, then $\frac{s}{n} \cdot n=s$ must be rational as well. Thus any element of an interval of the form $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ will be rational.

Here we will take a moment to remember that
$
\begin{align}
a&<q<b \\
a'=a-q&<0<b-q=b'
\end{align}
$
$n$ is any arbitrary natural number, so as we increase $n$ it will have the effect of scaling up this interval to any desired size while keeping all its members rational. This allows us to show that irrational numbers don't exist, which is obviously false. But for the sake of precision let us take a specific natural number for our contradiction.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there will be an $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m> \frac{3}{b'}$. Therefore $b' \cdot m >3$. $m\cdot b'>3>\sqrt{ 3 }$, and $\sqrt{ 3 }>0>a'\cdot m$. This implies that $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is in the interval $(m\cdot a',m\cdot b')$, making it rational. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 32|#Theorem 1 32]] $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational, giving us our contradiction and completing the proof.

##### Exercise 1.53*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  if $a<b$, then the interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many irrational number.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 52|#Exercise 1 52]] each of them will produce a unique irrational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of irrationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Exercise 1.54 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove that if $z$ is an upper bound for $A$, and $z \in A$, then it must be true that $z=sup(A)$.

- Because $z$ is already established as an upper bound, the only thing which we have to show is that $z\leq b$, where $b$ is any other upper bound.
- We will prove by contradiction
- Assume there is an upper bound $b<z$ outside of the set. But since $z$ is in the set it is not an upper bound. Therefore we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.55*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Archimedean Principle was presented as an axiom. Show that, in fact, the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

Arch: For any b in the Real Numbers there exists a natural number $n > b$.

Axiom: For any nonempty subset of R which is bounded above there exists a least upper bound.

We will prove this by contradiction. Our initial assumption is that the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle, which is logically equivalent to the Archimedean Principle being true and the Axiom of Completeness being false.

Let us assume that the Axiom of Completeness is true and that the Archimedean Principle is not true.

That the Archimedean Principle is not true implies that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \ngtr b$. Then $b$ would be an upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$. By the Axiom of Completeness, $\mathbb{N}$ must have a least upper bound as it is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and it is bounded above.

Let us call this least upper bound $m$. If $m$ is a least upper bound, then $m - 1$ cannot be a bound to $\mathbb{N}$. Since $m - 1$ is not an upper bound, that implies that $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} | n > m - 1$. This in turn implies that $m < n + 1$. However, because the $\mathbb{N}$ are closed under addition, $n + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and because $m$ is now shown to be less than a natural number, it cannot be the least upper bound. This is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be false. That the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle is untrue. We have therefore proven that the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

##### Exercise 1.56*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Axiom of Completeness stipulates, in a very specific way, that the set of real number, $\mathbb{R}$, completes the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$. To appreciate this, suppose that you are working in a number universe consisting of only rational numbers. Show that there does exist a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $S$ has a rational upper bound and yet $S$ has no rational least upper bound.

Consider the set $S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} | x \cdot x < 2\}$.

Let us find the least upper bound $s$ of the set $S$. We propose $\sqrt{2}$ as $s$, and will show that both $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ and that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

First let us demonstrate that $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ with a proof by contradiction. Suppose $\exists x \in S | x > \sqrt{2}$. Then $x^{2} > 2$, and by the definition of $S$, $S$ cannot contain $x$. Thus, our initial assumption must be false, and $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$.

Second let us demonstrate that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$, also with a proof by contradiction. Let us then suppose that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | b < s$. Then by the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ proved in exercise 1.5, we know that $\exists n \in \mathbb{Q} | b < n < s$. From this we know that $n^{2} < s^{2}$, or that $n^{2} < 2$. Since $n \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $n^{2} < 2$, by definition of $S$, $n \in S$. Because $n \in S$ and $n > b$, $b$ cannot be an upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; therefore $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

Therefore, $s = \sqrt{2}$ is the least upper bound of $S$. It should be clear that $S$ has no end of rational upper bounds; however $S$ has a irrational least upper bound.

##### Exercise 1.57*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose that $p$ is a prime number. Show that there is no rational number $z$ that satifies $z^{2}=p$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose there is a $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\frac{a}{b} = z$ and $z^{2}=p$, and $\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest form.
$
\begin{align}
\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{2} &= p \\
a^{2} &= pb^{2}
\end{align}
$
From this statement we can see that $p$ is a factor of $a$. If it were not then $a^{2}$ would not have it as a factor either, which it clearly does. Thus we can write $a = px$, where $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
$
\begin{align}
(px)^{2} &= pb^{2} \\
px^{2} &= b^{2}
\end{align}
$
By the same argument we can see that $p$ is also a factor of $b$. But if $p$ is a factor of both $b$ and $a$, then $\frac{a}{b}$ is not in lowest form, and we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.58*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $p$ is a positive number. Use the Axiom of Completeness to show that there is a number $z \in\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $z^{2}=p$.

Let $s$ be the least upper bound of the set $S=\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^{2} < p\}$.

Let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$. We begin by assuming that $s^{2} < p$.

Consider $(s + \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s + \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon < 1$, $\epsilon^{2} < \epsilon$, and since $p > s$:

$
\begin{gather*}
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1)
\end{gather*}
$

Let us now choose an $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2}$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2} \\
	s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p
\end{gather*}
$

From our initial comparison $s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon$ and $s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p$ we may conclude that $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$.

Since $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$, $(s + \epsilon) \in S$ and $(s + \epsilon) > s$. Therefore, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$ and we have run into a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong and $s^{2} \nless p$.

Now let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \ngtr p$. Let us then initially assume that $s^{2} > p$.

Consider $(s - \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s - \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon$, $s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon$. Let us then choose an $\epsilon$ such that $s \epsilon < s^{2} - p$. Then $s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$, $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$, $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ by the definition of $S$. Since $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ and it is smaller than $s$, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be incorrect and $s^{2} \ngtr p$.

Since we have shown through contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$ and $s^{2} \ngtr p$, $s^{2}$ must equal $p$. Thus $s$ is a real number which satisfies $s^{2} = p$.

- Show that $-\text{inf(S)}$ is an upper bound for T
- Show that the negative of the set of all the lower bounds of T is the same as the set of all of the upper bounds for t. 
- Show that the negative of every lower bound  is an upper bound.

> Given a point $p \in \mathbb{R}$, and a number $\epsilon$, the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $p$ (sometimes written as the $\epsilon$-nbdh of $p$) is the set of points whose distance from $p$ is less than $\epsilon$. Notationally, this is written as $N_{p}:=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}:\left| x-p \right|<\epsilon \}$.

##### Exercise 2.2
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $a<b$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $S=(a,b)$. Prove that for each $c \in S$, there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(c)\subseteq S$. (Is this true if we used $S=(a,b]$?)

Let $\epsilon = min\left\{  \frac{\left| c-a \right|}{2}, \frac{\left| b-c \right|}{2}  \right\}$. 
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $a$:
$
c-\frac{c-a}{2}=\frac{c}{2} + \frac{a}{2}> \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}>a \\
$
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $b$:
$
c+ \frac{b-c}{2}=\frac{b}{2}+\frac{c}{2}< \frac{b}{2}+\frac{b}{2}=b
$
From these cases it is clear that $\forall x \in N_{\epsilon}$ will be inside $S$. This is not true for the interval $S=(a,b]$ because $b+\epsilon>b$ for any value of $\epsilon>0$.

2. $N_{0.02}^{*}(4)=(3.98,4)\cup (4,4.02)$

2. If $\epsilon<12$: $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)$ and $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in S$. If $\epsilon\geq 12$: $3.99\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)$ and $3.99 \in S$

##### Definition 2.6
> [!none]
> Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a set, and let $p \in\mathbb{R}$. We say that $p$ is an **accumulation point** of $S$ if and only if, for all $\epsilon>0$, the intersection $S\cap N_{\epsilon}^{*}(p)$ is nonempty. We will use $S'$ to denote the set of all accumulation points of $S$, ie

##### Exercise 2.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that 2 is an accumulation point of the set $[0,2)$

For any $2>\epsilon>0$ the point $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in (0,2]$. If $\epsilon\geq2$ the point $1 \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $1 \in (0,2]$. Therefore, by definition $2$ is an accumulation point of the set $(0,2]$

##### Exercise 2.8
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that $\pi$ is an accumulation point of $Q$. 

Given an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there will be a rational number in between the interval $(\pi,\epsilon)\subseteq N_{\epsilon}^{*}(\pi )$.

##### Exercise 2.9 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  What does it mean for a point p to not be an accumulation point of a set $S$? Show that neither $2$ nor $\pi$ are accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

It means that there exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that there are no points in the set within that $\epsilon$ radius of $p$.

For example, take $\epsilon=0.1$. There are no integers in the sets $(1.9,2.1)\text{ \\ }\{ 2 \}$ or the set $(\pi-0.1,\pi+0.1)\text{ \\ }\{ \pi \}$. Thus they are no accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

#### 2.2 Main Theorems

##### Definition 2.10
> [!none] 
> Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$. The **closure** of $S$ is the set that is created by taking $S$ along with its accumulation points. We use the notation
> $
> cl(S):=S\cup S'.

##### Definition 2.11
> [!none] 
> Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$ We say that $S$ is a **closed set** if and only if $S=cl(S)$.

##### Exercise 2.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that $S$ is closed if and only if $S'\subseteq S$.

Proof by contradiction: If this were false there would be an element $x \in S'$ and $x \cancel{ \in } S$ and $S$ would have to be closed. This would mean that $x \in S\cup S'$, but we have already established that $x$ is not in $S$, therefore $S\neq S\cup S'$, meaning it is not closed, and we have a contradiction. 

##### Exercise 2.13
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $S=(0,4)$. Show that $0,4,$ and $2$ are all accumulation points of $S$.

1. $0$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(0)\cap(0,4)$.
2. $4$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)\cap(0,4)$
3. $2$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $2+\epsilon \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(2)\cap(0,4)$ 

##### Exercise 2.14

$cl(S)=[0,4]$

##### Theorem 2.15
> [!none]
> - [>]  Let $A,B\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $(A\cup B)'$, then $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$.

We will prove by contraposition. The above statement is logically equivalent to: if $x \notin A'$ and $x \notin B'$, then $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

By the definition of $x$ not being in $A'$, there exists a $\epsilon$ such that $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap A$ is an empty set. Likewise there must exists a $\delta$ such that $N_{\delta }^{*}(x)\cap B$ is empty as well. WLOG $\delta<\epsilon$. Because $N_{\delta}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\epsilon  }^{*}(x)$ there are no points from $A$ *or* $B$ that are in the deleted delta-neighborhood of $x$. This is is essentially the definition of what it means for $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

##### Corollary 2.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of two closed sets is closed.

Let $A$ and $B$ both be closed sets. For any $x \in (A\cup B)'$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 15|#Theorem 2 15]] $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$. But because $A$ and $B$ are closed $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$, and thus $A',B' \subseteq A\cup B$, and $x \in A\cup B$. This shows that $(A\cup B)'\subseteq A\cup B$, which by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] makes $A\cup B$ closed.

##### Lemma 2.16.1
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $(a,b)\cap S'$ is nonempty, then $(a,b)\cap S$ is nonempty as well

From the hypothesis of the statement, we know there exists an element $x \in (a,b)$ and $x \in S'$. Because $x \in S'$ there must then exists $y \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ for all $\epsilon>0$. Let $c=min(\{ \left| b-x \right|,\left| x-a \right| \})$. Consider an $\epsilon|\epsilon<c$. $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)=(x-c,x+c)$. By the construction of $c$, $x-c\geq a$ and $x+c\leq b$. This implies that $y$ must be in $(a,b)$. Thus we have produced an element $y \in (a,b)\cap S$.

##### Theorem 2.17
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Given any set $S$, the set $S'$ is a closed set

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] we must show that $S''\in S'$. This means that if $y \in S''$, for an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ we must produce an element $x$ such that $x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$.

By definition of $y \in S''$, $\forall \delta >0$ $N_{\delta}^{*}(y)\cap S'\neq \emptyset$. Let $\delta=\epsilon$ in this case. Because the set is nonempty we can product an element $z$ inside of it. By construction this $z \in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon)$ and $z \in S'$. Because $z \in S'$ we can produce an $x$ such that for an arbitrary $\alpha$, $N_{\alpha}^{*}(z)\cap S\neq \emptyset$. Because $\delta$ is arbitrary, if we set it $=min\{ \left| (y+\epsilon) -z \right|, \left| z- (y-\epsilon) \right| \}$ $x$ is guaranteed to be in the interval $(y-\epsilon, y+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because $x$ must also be in $S$ we have assured that for an arbitrary $\epsilon$ $\exists x|x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$. Thus that set is not empty and we have accomplished our goal.

##### Corollary 2.18
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Given a set $S \subseteq  R$, the set $cl(S)$ is a closed set.

By definition $cl(S):=S\cup S'$. Given any accumulation point of $cl(S)'$ we must show that it is in $cl(S)$ ([[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). If $y \in cl(S)'$ then for all $\epsilon>0$ there $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap(S\cup S')$ must be nonempty. This is logically equivalent to $(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S)\cup(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')\neq \emptyset$. This means that there exists a $z$ such that $z \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ *or* $z \in (N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')$. If the first case is true, then by definition $y \in S'$. In the second case, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 2 16 1|#Lemma 2 16 1]] $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ must be nonempty, which again by definition makes $y \in S'$. Thus we have showed that for any point in $cl(S)'$, it must also be in $cl(S)=S\cup S'$, and by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]], it must be closed

##### Theorem 2.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of a finite number of closed sets is a closed set.

We must show that for any natural number $n\leq2$ the union of $n$ closed sets are closed.

Base case: for $n=2$, we simply have to refer to [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]].

Inductive hypothesis: Suppose that the union of $n$ closed sets is closed. We must show that the union of $n+1$ sets is closed.

By the inductive hypothesis for any sequence of closed sets $\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}$ is closed. $\cup_{i=2}^{n+1}C_{i}=\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}\cup C_{n+1}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]] this must also be closed, and by mathematical induction the union of any finite set of closed intervals will be closed as well.

##### Theorem 2.20
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The intersection of any collection of closed sets is a closed set.

Suppose $\{S_{i}\}$ is a collection of closed sets, either finite or infinite. We must show that if for all values of $i$ $S_{i}$ will be closed, then the intersection of all of these sets is closed. We will do this through contradiction. 

Assume that the theorem is false, and there exists a collection of sets $S_{i}$ which are all closed, yet their intersection (denoted $\cap S_{i}$) is not closed. $\cap S_{i}$ not being closed implies that $(\cap S_{i})'\nsubseteq\cap S_{i}$ (by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). Thus
$
\begin{align}
\exists x &\in (\cap S_{i})'|x \notin S_{i}, \text{ where }S_{i}\text{ is at least one of the sets}\\
\forall \epsilon&>0(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap(\cap S_{i})\neq \emptyset)
\end{align}
$
This implies that for any $S_{i}$, $N_{\epsilon^{*}}(x)\cap S_{i}\neq0$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point for every $S_{i}$. Because each $S_{i}$ is closed this guarantees that $x \in S_{i}$, for all $S_{i}$ as well, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]'s formulation of the definition of being closed. But this contradicts what we said earlier, finishing our proof.

##### Exercise 2.30*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if every nonempty interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.

Let $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. From the definition of dense, we know that $\mathbb{R}\subseteq\text{cl}(S)$, or equivalently, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. This means that every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is either an element of $S$ or is an accumulation point of $S$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $x\in\mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $S$, then we know that $(a,b)$ contains an element of $S$. If $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, then we know for some $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. In other words, the deleted neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one element of $S$. If $\epsilon<\text{min}\{|x-a|,|x-b|\}$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\subseteq (a,b)$. This means that at least one element of $S$ is also in $(a,b)$.

Therefore, if $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, then every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.


Suppose now that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S. This means for some distinct $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ where $\epsilon>0$ and some distinct $x\in\mathbb{R}$, the intervals $(x-\epsilon,x)$ and $(x,x+\epsilon)$ will each contain an element of $S$.

We can see that $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^*(x)$, and since there is at least two elements of $S$ in $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. This means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.

Since every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be described as an accumulation point of $S$, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. Therefore if every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S, then $S$ is dense in $R$.
 
##### Corollary 2.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  $Q$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

In order for $\mathbb{Q}$ to be dense in $\mathbb{R}$, it must be the case that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, since between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number. This means every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 2.38*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use induction to prove that $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, each of length $(\frac{1}{3})^{n}$.

Base case: $C_{0}$ is the closed interval $[0,1]$ which clearly has length $1=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{0}$ , and there is only one interval ($1=2^{0}$). Thus the base case checks out.

Inductive hypothesis: We assume that $C_{n}$ has a $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, and we must show that $C_{n+1}$ has $2^{n+1}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

In definition of the Cantor set we were told that to construct the next "partial Cantor set" set you take each interval of the previous set and remove the open third of the interval. When you do this you split each interval into two intervals, doubling the number of intervals. Thus if $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, $C_{n+1}$ will have $2^{n}\cdot2=2^{n+1}$ intervals. When the middle third of each interval is removed the split intervals will have $\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the interval they were split from. So if each interval in $C_{n}$ has length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, then each interval in $C_{n+1}$ will have length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified, and by induction for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $C_{n}$ will have $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

##### Exercise 2.39*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Find at least three distinct points in the Cantor Set.

When we remove the middle third of each interval the endpoints of each interval are never removed. Thus an endpoint for $C_{n}$ will be an endpoint for every $C_{m}$ where $m>n$. In addition, because every $C_{n}$ is a subset of every $C_{l}$ where $l<n$, every endpoint of $C_{n}$ will be contained in $C_{l}$. Thus any endpoint of any of the sets will be in the Cantor set. Consider the set $\left\{  0,1, \frac{1}{3}  \right\}$. All the elements in the set are endpoints of $C_{1}$, so they must be in the Cantor set.

##### Exercise 2.40*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor Set is a closed set.

Every $C_{n}$ is a union of a finite number of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]] every $C_{n}$ is closed. Because $C_{\infty}$ is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, which are all closed, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $C_{\infty}$ must be closed as well.

##### Exercise 2.41*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor set is nowhere **dense**.

To be nowhere dense there must be no $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. We will prove this by contradiction.

Assume there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. Because the Cantor set is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, $(a,b)$ must be a subset of every $C_{n}$. Let $c= \left| a-b \right|$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] for some natural number $m$, $\frac{1}{m}<c$. $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{m}< \frac{1}{m}$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $C_{n}$ it will be made up of intervals of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. Thus we can produce a $C_{m}$ which is the union of a disjoint set of intervals, each of which are smaller than $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)$ cannot be a subset of $C_{m}$, otherwise $C_{m}$ would contain an interval larger than $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. This is contradiction, showing that our initial assumption is false, and the Cantor set must be **nowhere dense**.

### Chapter 3

#### 3.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 3.1
> [!none] 
> Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. A point $p \in S$ is said to be an interior point of $S$ if and only if there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(p)\subseteq S$. The set of all interior points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as the interior of $S$) will be denoted by $S^{\circ}$.

##### Definition 3.2
> [!none] 
> A point $q \in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}(q)$ contains at least one element of $S$ and at least one element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. The set of all boundary points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as **the boundary of $S$**) will be denoted by $\partial(S)$.

##### Exercise 3.3 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For a set $S \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\partial (S)=\partial (\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

If $T= \mathbb{R}\setminus S$, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus T=S$. For every boundary point no matter how small of an interval around that point there is there must be an element of $S$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But any element of $S$ is an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus T$, and every element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is an element of $T$. Therefore the point must be a boundary point for $T=\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well. Showing the implication the other way is very simple.

##### Exercise 3.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $S'$ is a subset of $\partial(S)$.

This is false. Consider the set $(0,1)$. $\frac{1}{2}$ is an accumulation point, but not a boundary point.

##### Exercise 3.5
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $\partial(S)$ is a subset of $S'$.

This is also false. Consider the set $\{ 1 \}$. In this set $1$ is a boundary point, but not an accumulation point. I believe if the definition of a boundary point was a deleted epsilon neighborhood instead of a regular epsilon neighborhood, then this would be true.

The definition of an interior point makes it clear that it must be an element of the set. Thus we only have to show that $(a,b)\subseteq (a,b)^{\circ}$.

For any point $x \in (a,b)$, if you take $\varepsilon=min\{ \left| x-a \right|,\left| b-x \right| \}$, then the interval $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will be contained in the set, making $x$ an interior point of $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)=(a,b)^{\circ}$.

##### Exercise 3.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: the set $\mathbb{R}$, as well as the empty set $\emptyset$, are both open and closed.

We will prove this statement true.

The empty set has no interior points, so it is equal to its interior, making it technically open. It also has no accumulation points, so they must be a subset of the set, making it also closed.

For any real number, any open interval containing the number will be a subset of the real numbers. This makes every real number part of the interior of $\mathbb{R}$, and thus making it open. Every accumulation point of $\mathbb{R}$ must be in $\mathbb{R}$, making it closed as well. 

##### Exercise 3.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $T$ is not open, then $T$ is closed.

We will prove this false. Consider the set $(0,1]$. This set is not open, but it is also not closed, providing a counterexample to the statement.

#### 3.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 3.13
> [!none] 
> - [>]  A set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. In other words, a set $S$ is open if and only if no boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

First we prove the forward direction: If $S$ is open, then all of the boundary are not elements of $S$.

For any $x \in \partial(S)$ by definition for all $\varepsilon>0$ the neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain a point in $S$ and a point not is $S$. Thus $N_{\varepsilon}$ cannot be a subset of $S$ because it contains an element not in $S$, meaning the point is not in the interior of $S$.

Next we prove the backward direction: If no boundary points are elements of $S$, then $S$ is an open set.

We will prove this by contraposition. The following statement is logically equivalent to the problem statement: If $S$ is not open, then there exists a boundary point which is an element of $S$.

If $S$ is not open that means there exists a point $x \in S|x \notin S^{\circ}$. Therefore for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain an element not in $S$. But because $x \in S$ it contains both a point in $S$, and a point not in $S$, making it a boundary point in $S$.

##### Lemma 3.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $S'\setminus S=\partial(S)\setminus S$.

Suppose $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain a point in $S$ because $x\in S'$. But because the neighborhood contains $x$, it also contains a point not in $S$. Thus it satisfies the criteria to be a boundary point and is not in $S$, so $x \in \partial(S)\setminus S$.

Now suppose $y$ is a boundary point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain one point in $S$ and one point not in $S$. Because $y \notin S$, the point in $S$ must be in $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$ this guarantees that $y \in S'$ by definition. We also know that $y \notin S$, so $y \in S'\setminus S$.

Because we have proved that $S'\setminus S\subseteq \partial(S)\setminus S$ and $\partial(S)\setminus S\subseteq S'\setminus S$, the two sets must be equal.

##### Lemma 3.14.1
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is a boundary point of $S$, and is not contained in $S$, then $x$ is an accumulation point.

By the definition of a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain at least one element of $S$. Because $x \notin S$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain the element of $S$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.
##### Theorem 3.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is a closed set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq S$. In other words, a set $S$ is closed if and only if all boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

Suppose $S$ is closed. We must show that all of its boundary points are elements of $S$. Let $x \in \partial(S)$. 
Suppose $x \notin S$, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 3 14 1|#Lemma 3 14 1]] it would be an accumulation point of $S$. Because $S$ is closed this implies that $x \in S$. This is a contradiction, meaning our assumption must be false and $x$ must be in $S$.

Now suppose all of the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$. We must show that $S$ is closed. Let us do this through contradiction.
Assume that all the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$, but $S$ is not closed. By the definition of $S$ not being closed, there must be a $x \in S'|x\notin S$. This means that for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain an element of $S$. $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ contains an element of $S$. Because it contains $x$ as well, it contains an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well, thus satisfying the definition of a boundary point. This means that $x$ is a boundary point of $S$ not within $S$, contradicting our initial assumption and completing the proof.

##### Corollary 3.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

First we must show the forward direction: If $S\in R$ is an open set, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

If $S$ is open, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $\partial(S)\subseteq(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. Therefore $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. Therefore by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

Now we must show the backward direction: If $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set, then $S$ is an open set.

By definition [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ being closed we know that $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But this implies that $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. So by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $S$ is open.

Q.E.D.

##### Theorem 3.17
> [!none]
> - [x]  The intersection of finitely many open sets is open

Consider $S=\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}S_{i}$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $S_{i}$ is open. Now consider the set $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$. Because $S_{i}$ is open [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]] guarantees $\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$ must be closed. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must then be closed because it is a union of a finite number of closed intervals ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]]). Then again by Corollary 3.16 $S$ must be open if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

##### Theorem 3.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of any collection of open sets is open.

Let $X$ be any collection of open sets. Let our set $S=\bigcup\limits_{O\in S}O$ where every $O \in S$ is open. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcap\limits_{O\in S}\mathbb{R}\setminus O$. Because every $O \in S$ is open, $\mathbb{R}\setminus O$ must be closed by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]]. This means that $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is the intersection of a collection of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must be closed. Because $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed, $S$ must be open by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]].

##### Example 3.19
> [!none] 
> $F=\{ (1,4),(1,2),(3,7) \}$ is a collection of three open sets. Notice that the interval $(1,2)$ is an element of $F$ (not a subset of $F$) so we can write $(1,2)\in F$. At the same time we have that $\{ (1,2) \}\subseteq  F$.

##### Definition 3.21
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then a collection $F$ of open sets is said to be an **open cover** for $S$ if and only if the union of all open sets in $F$ contains the set $S$. That is, $F$ is an open cover for $S$ if and only if

> However, $F$ is not an open cover for the set $[0,1]$. (Why?)

$0 \in [0,1]$ is not in any interval of the form $(0,i)$ where $i \in I=\mathbb{N}$. Thus it is not "covered" by $F$.

##### Exercise 3.23
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set. Show that there exists an open cover of $S$, $F=\{ O_{i}: \in I \}$ such that every open set $O_{i}$ in $F$ is a subset of $S$.

Consider the open set $(0,1)$. If we set $O_{1}=\left( 0, \frac{3}{4} \right)$, and $O_{2}=\left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)$. Note that both sets are subsets of $(0,1)$. Let $I=\{ 1,2 \}$. Let $F=\{ O_{i}|i \in I \}$. $\bigcup\limits_{O \in F}O=(0,1)$ and thus $F$ is an open cover comprised of only subsets of $(0,1)$.

3. Let $I=\mathbb{N}$, and for every $i \in I$ let $O_{i}=(i-1,i+1)$. $F=\{ O_{i}|i \in I \}$.

#### 3.3 Follow Up Work

##### Exercise 3.25
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Develop complete proofs of all the lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Exercise 3.26*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or Disprove: Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S\setminus S'=S\setminus \partial(S)$.

We will prove this statement false. Consider the natural numbers. Clearly the set $N_{0.5}^{*}(1)\cap \mathbb{N}$ empty, and thus by definition $1$ cannot be an accumulation point and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}'$.

We must now show that $1$ *is* a boundary point for $\mathbb{N}$. If we consider any $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ will contain an element of $\mathbb{N}$ (namely, $1$). If we consider the deleted neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(1)=(1-\varepsilon,1+\varepsilon)$, it is an interval, so it must contain an infinite amount of points. But in between any two real numbers ($1-\varepsilon$ and $1+\varepsilon$) there can only be a finite number of natural numbers. Thus there must be elements in the interval which are not in $\mathbb{N}$ and for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ contains an element of the natural numbers, and element not in the natural numbers, satisfying the definition of a boundary point.

Obviously $1\in \mathbb{N}$, so we have show that $1 \in \mathbb{N}\setminus \partial(\mathbb{N})$ and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}\setminus  \mathbb{N}'$. Thus the two sets are not equal and the statement has been disproven.

##### Exercise 3.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ closed and $T$ is open, then $S\cap T$ is not open.

This is false. Consider $S=[0,10]$ and $T=(2,6)$. $S\cap T=(2,6)$, which is open.

##### Exercise 3.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $T\setminus S$ is open.

We will disprove this statement. Let $T=[0,10]$ and $S=(4,6)$. $T\setminus S=[0,4]\cup [6,10]$, which is a closed set.

##### Exercise 3.29*
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $S\setminus T$ is open.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] if we can show for all elements $x \in \partial(S\setminus T)$, $x\notin S\setminus T$, then $S\setminus T$ must be open. $x \notin S\setminus T$ is equivalent to $x \in T \lor x \notin S$.

Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\partial(S\setminus T)$. We must show that $x \in T$, or $x$ is not in $S$ in order to prove that $S\setminus T$ is open. 

By the definition of a boundary point for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $y \in N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ such that $y \in R\setminus(S\setminus T)\Leftrightarrow y \in T \lor y \notin S$.

In the case where $y \notin S$, it is impossible for $x$ to be an interior point. Because $S$ is open, that means that $x \notin S$.
In the case where $y \in T$, we have that $x$ is an accumulation point. Because $T$ is closed, this implies $x \in T$.

Both of these outcomes are sufficient to guarantee that $S\setminus T$ is open.

##### Theorem 3.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $cl(S)=S \cup \partial(S)$.

First we will show that $cl(S)=S\cup S'\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$. Let $x$ be an element of $S\cup S'$. If $x \in S$ then it is clearly also in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Consider the case where $x \notin S$ and $x \in S'$. If we consider neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, it must include an element not in $S$ (namely, $x$), and because it is an accumulation point it must also contain an element *in* $S$. By definition this makes it an accumulation point. Thus every element of $S\cup S'$ is an element of $S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S\cup S'\subseteq S \cup \partial(S)$.

Now we must show that $S\cup \partial(S)\subseteq S\cup S'$. Consider a $y$ in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Again, if $y$ is in $S$ it obviously must be in $S\cup S'$. Consider the case where it is not and $y \in \partial(S)$ and $y \notin S$. Because $y$ is a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$. $y$ is not in $S$, so $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. By definition this makes $y \in S'$ and thus $y \in S\cup S'$.

Thus we have show that $cl(S)\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S \cup \partial(S) \subseteq cl(S)$, so they must be equal.

##### Exercise 3.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=(0,1)$ and let $F=\left\{  \left( 0,1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)|n \in \mathbb{N}  \right\}$. Is $F$ an open cover for $S$? Show that there is no finite subset of $F$ which also covers $S$.

We will prove that $F$ is indeed an open cover for $(0,1)$. 

If we consider any number $x \in (0,1)$, there will always exist an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}<1-x$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]]. Therefore $x<1-\frac{1}{n}$. We also know that $x>0$ (because $x \in (0,1)$), so $x \in \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By construction this means that $x$ is in one of the elements of $S$, and thus must be in the union of all of the elements of $F$. Because $x$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, this implies that $F$ is an open cover for $(0,1)$.

For any finite subset of $F$ which we will call $F'$, consider the set $S=\left\{  n \in \mathbb{N}|\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)\in F'  \right\}$. Because this set is finite we can select a maximal element which we will call $b$. Notice that for every $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$ if $x<y$ then $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{x} \right)\subseteq\left( 0,1-\frac{1}{y} \right)$. We selected $b$ as a maximal element of $S$, so for every interval in $F'$, it must be a subset of $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{b} \right)$. Thus if there is a number which is not in $\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$ it will not be in any element of $F'$.

Now consider the endpoint of that interval $1-\frac{1}{b}$. Because it is an open interval $1-\frac{1}{b}\notin \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$. $b$ is a natural number, so $\frac{1}{b}$ is less than one (in the case where $b=1$ the set would be empty), and greater than zero. Thus $0<1- \frac{1}{b}<1$, and $1- \frac{1}{b} \in (0,1)$. We have produced a number which is in $(0,1)$, but is not "covered" by $F$.

#### 4.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 4.1
> [!none] 
> A function $a:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ is called a sequence. When discussing a sequence, we will typically denote individual elements of the range using subscripts: $a_{i}:=a(1),a_{2}:=a(2)$, etc. We will then denote the entire sequence by $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$, or $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots)$, or simple just by $a_{n}$.

##### Example 4.2
> [!none] 
> The sequence $(n^{2})_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,4,9,16,\dots)$ is the sequence of each of the natural numbers squared. It is clear that the further we go in the sequence, the larger the sequence elements become.

##### Example 4.3
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \sin\left( \frac{\pi n}{2} \right) \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0)$ is a sequence that taeks on the values of $1,0,$ and $-1$ in a repeating pattern. It is clear that the pattern displayed in this sequence will continue forever.

##### Example 4.4
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \frac{n+5}{n} \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has its first few terms as 5,3,7/3,2,9/5,5/3,... It appears that the terms in this sequence are getting smaller; but it is unclear at first glance whether this trend continues. If we look out a bit into the sequence, we see that $a_{100}=\frac{105}{100}=1.05$, and if go really far we see that $a_{8745}\approx 1.00057$. So it seems like the "long-term" behavior of this sequence is to have sequence elements that "get close to" the number 1.

##### Definition 4.5
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to **converge to a number** $L$ if and only if $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$ then $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. In this case, we say that the $(a_{n})$ is a **convergent sequence** and that the number $L$ is a **limit** of the sequence ($a_{n}$).

##### Definition 4.6
> [!none] 
> A sequence ($a_{n}$) is said to **eventually** have a property $P$ if and only if there exists an $N$ such that, whenever $n>N$, $a_{n}$ has property $P$. In other words: ($a_{n}$) eventually has property $P$ if there exists an $N$ such that every term with index greater than $N$ has property $P$.

##### Exercise 4.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }$. Show that $a_{n}$ will eventually be greater than or equal to $10$. 

We will do this through proof by induction.

Base case: $a_{100}=10$.

Inductive hypothesis: $\sqrt{ n+x }$ is always greater than $\sqrt{ n }$ if $x>0$. Thus if if any $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }\geq10$, then $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{ n+1 }$ must be as well. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\geq100$, $a_{n}\leq10$ .

##### Theorem 4.8 (Uniqueness of Limits)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L$, and also converges to a number $M$. Then $L=M$.

$L=M$ if and only if $\left| L-M \right|<0$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. Suppose we choose an $N$ such that if $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $\left| a_{n}-M \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. By the triangle inequality
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-L-(a_{n}-M) \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\left| M-L \right| <\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus $M$ must equal $L$.

##### Example 4.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$.
> 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\frac{1}{n}$ can be smaller than any real number. Consider $\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|=\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ we can produce an $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than it, so the limit must be 0.

##### Example 4.10
> [!none] 
> Use the definition of limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{2n+1}{3n+4}= \frac{2}{3}$.

This proof is not that hard, but very lengthy, so just refer to the books if you need to.

##### Exercise 4.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}=1$.

$\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}= \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 9|#Example 4 9]] we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{n}=0$, so our limit must equal 1.

##### Exercise 4.12
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Use the definition of limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{4n-5}{n+2}=4$.

This is essentially identical to [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 10|#Example 4 10]]. 
##### Exercise 4.13
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. What does it mean for a number $L$ to not a a limit of $a_{n}$?

If $L$ is a limit of $a_{n}$ that means
$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists N \in\mathbb{N}|\forall n>N (\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon)
$

For $L$ to not be a limit of $a_{n}$ we negate the definition to get
$
\exists\varepsilon>0|\forall N \in\mathbb{N},\exists n>N|(\left| a_{n}-L \right| \geq\varepsilon )
$

In words: There exists an $\varepsilon$ greater than zero such that for all $N$ in the natural numbers there will exists an $n$ greater than $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is not within a distance $\varepsilon$ of $L$.

##### Exercise 4.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,\dots)$ does not converge to the number 1.

Consider an $\varepsilon=0.5$. For any $N$ there will always be an $n$ such that $a_{n}=-1$ and $\left| a_{n}-1 \right|=2\geq0.5$. Thus the definition for not being a limit point as given in the previous exercise has been fulfilled and $1$ is not a limit of the sequence.

#### 4.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 4.15 (First Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B \text{ and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}-b_{n})=A-B.
> \end{align}
> $

$(i)$
Let $\varepsilon>0$.
By definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall n>N_{1},\left| a_{n}-A \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall n>N_{2},\left| b_{n}-B \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\end{align}
$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$. For all $n>N$
$
\begin{align}
&\left| a_{n}+b_{n}-(A+B) \right|= \left| (a_{n}-A)+(b_{n}-B) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-A \right|+\left| b_{n}-B \right|  < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
The triangle allows the first line to be less than or equal to the second line.
By definition this means that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B$.

$(ii)$
Consider the sequence $-b_{n}$. We will show that its limit is $-B$. $\left| -b_{n}-(-B) \right|=\left| B-b_{n} \right|$ which we can make arbitrarily small cause $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$. Then we just use the previous result and add $a_{n}+(-b_{n})$, and their limits will add, meaning $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}-b_{n}=A-B)$

##### Theorem 4.16 (Second Algebraic Limit Theorem)

$(i)$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}b_{n}-AB \right|&=\left| a_{n}b_{n}-Ab_{n}+Ab_{n}-AB \right|  \\
&= \left| b_{n}(a_{n}-A) +A(b_{n}-B)\right| \\
&\leq \left| b_{n} \right| \left| a_{n} -A\right|+\left| A \right| \left| b_{n}-B \right|   
\end{align}
$

By definition of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ we can make $\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ and $\left| b_{n}-B \right|$ as small as we would like. Thus the only thing we need to show in order to make the expression less than $\varepsilon$ is to show that $b_{n}$ will be bounded, so we can make $\left| b_{n} \right|\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ as small as we would like. A much more fleshed out argument is given in the book.

$(ii)$
The crux of this proof is in the fact that
$
\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right| =\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{B\cdot b_{n}} \right| 
$
and we can make $B-b_{n}$ as small as we want, and $B\cdot b_{n}$ is bounded. Thus $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$, and then we can just think of this as the multiplication of two series.
##### Theorem 4.17 (Order Limit Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence that converges to a limit $A$. If $a_{n}\geq0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq0$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose that $A<0$. By definition of a limit we can produce an $a_{n}$ such that $\left| a_{n}-A \right|<\left| A \right|$. Because $a_{n}>A$ and $A<0$ this is equivalent to $a_{n}-A<-A$. But this would imply that $a_{n}$ is negative, giving us our contradiction.

##### Corollary 4.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ and $(b_{n})$ be sequences that converge to limits $A$ and $B$, respectfully. If $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq B$.

Consider the sequence $c_{n}=a_{n}-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B$. Because $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $a_{n}-b_{n}\leq0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B\geq0\to A\geq B$. 

##### Definition 4.19
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **bounded** if and only if $\exists B>0$ such that $\left| a_{n} \right|<B$, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, a sequence is bounded if there exists two number $B_{1},B_{2}$ such that $B_{1}<a_{n}<B_{2}$ for every sequence element $a_{n}$.

##### Definition 4.20
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **increasing** (resp. strictly increasing) if and only if $a_{n+1}>a_{n}$ ($a_{n+1}>a_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Similarly, a sequence $(b_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **decreasing** (strictly decreasing) if and only if $b_{n+1}\leq b_{n}$ ($b_{n+1}<b_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. A sequence is said to be **monotone** if and only if the sequence is increasing or is decreasing.

##### Theorem 4.21 (Monotone Convergence Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Every bounded monotone sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ converges.

We will prove that every bounded increasing sequence will converge, but the proof that every bounded decreasing sequence will converge is structured exactly the same.

Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ is bounded and increasing. Let $S=\{ a_{n}|n \in \mathbb{N} \}$, and $m=\text{ sup}(S)$ (we know that $\text{ sup}(S)$ exists because $S$ is bounded). We will use $m$ as a candidate limit for $a_{n}$. Let $\varepsilon>0$. There must exists an $x \in S$ such that $m-\varepsilon<x<m$, by the definition of a supremum. Because $x \in S$ that means $\exists l \in N|a_{l}=x$ and $m-\varepsilon<a_{l}<\varepsilon$. $a_{n}$ is increasing, so for every $n>l$, $m>a_{n}>a_{l}>m-\varepsilon$ ($a_{n}$ must be $<m$ because $m$ is the supremum). Therefore every element after $a_{l} \in N_{\varepsilon}(m)$, and thus $m$ must be the limit of the sequence.

> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Develop complete proofs of all lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Lemma 4.23
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $b_{n}$ converges to a number $B\neq 0$. Then there exists a constant $\alpha>0$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ sufficiently large. (Here, we say that $b_{n}$ is eventually bounded away from zero.)

First we will show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N$, $b_{n}\in N_{B}(B)$. Let $n>N$.

If $B\geq0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{+}$ so every $b_{n}$ must be positive. If this is the case then $\left| b_{n} \right|=b_{n}$ and clearly the two must have the same limit $\left| B \right|=B$.
If $B<0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{-}$ and every $b_{n}$ must be negative. Thus $\left| b_{n} \right|=-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }-b_{n}=-B=\left| B \right|$. Thus is both cases $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$.

Using this fact let we know that $0<\left| B \right|=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|$. Let $\alpha$ be a real number such that $0<\alpha<\left| B \right|$. We can now produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N, \left| b_{n} \right|\in N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(\left| B \right|)$. Every element in $N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(B)$ is greater than $\alpha$, so we $N$ is the number we were seeking to produce and we are done.

##### Exercise 4.24*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove part $(ii)$ of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]]

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed number.

Because $B\neq0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 23|#Lemma 4 23]] there exists an $\alpha$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ greater than some $N_{1}\in\mathbb{N}$. It then follows that $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}} \right|< \frac{1}{\alpha}$.
Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there exists an $N_{2}$ such that $\forall n >N_{2}$
$
\left| b_{n}-B \right|<\left| B\alpha \right|\cdot \varepsilon  
$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$ and suppose that $n>N$.
$
\begin{align}
&\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}  -\frac{1}{B} \right|=\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{Bb_{n}} \right| =\left| \frac{1}{Bb_{n}} \right|\left| B-b_{n} \right|    \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha} \right| \left| B-b_{n} \right|  \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha } \right| \left| B\alpha \cdot \varepsilon  \right| =\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
Therefore for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists an $N$ such that $\forall n >N$, $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right|<\varepsilon$ and thus by definition $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$. We know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$, so using part $(i)$. of the Second Algebraic Limit Theorem we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\cdot \frac{1}{b_{n}}=A/B$.

##### Theorem 4.25 (The Squeeze Theorem for Sequences)*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$, and $c_{n}$ are three sequences, and suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}$. If $a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}$ for all $n$ sufficiently large, then $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L.$

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

By the definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall  n >N_{1},\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall  n >N_{2},\left| b_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\end{align}
$
Let $n>max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$
$
\begin{align}
\left| L-a_{n} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
L-a_{n}&<\varepsilon \\
a_{n}&>L-\varepsilon \\
\left| b_{n}-L \right| &<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}-L&<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}&<\varepsilon+L
\end{align}
$
Therefore
$
\displaylines{
L-\varepsilon<a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}<\varepsilon+L\\
-\varepsilon<c_{n}-L<\varepsilon
}
$
Thus $\left| c_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$, and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L$.

##### Exercise 4.26
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Show that if $a_{n}$ converges to a limit $L$, then $a_{n}$ is bounded.

Choose a specific $\varepsilon>0$. By the definition of a limit $\exists N$ such that $\forall n>N, a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Thus every term after $a_{N}$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon+L$ and bounded below by $L-\varepsilon$. If we look at the sequence $a_{1-(N-1)}$, it is finite, so it must have an upper bound $M_{1}$ and a lower bound $B_{1}$. If we let $M=max\{ M_{1},\varepsilon+L \}$ and $B=\{ B_{1},L-\varepsilon \}$ then $M$ and $B$ will bound the whole sequence.

##### Defintion 4.27
> [!none] 
> We say that a sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is **in a set** $S$ if and only if $a_{n} \in S$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

##### Lemma 4.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ is a sequence in $S$, and suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L.$ Then $L \in S\cup S'$.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. 

Case 1: $L \in S$. We are done.

Case 2: $L\notin S$. We must show that $L \in S'$.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By the definition of a limit, $\exists N$ such that for all $n>N$ $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Suppose that every sequence element $a_{n}=L$. This would mean that the limit $L$ would equal $a_{n}$, which is an element of $S$, giving a contradiction. So there must be at least one $a_{i}$ where $i\geq n$ and $a_{i} \neq L$. Thus $a_{i}\in N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(L)$ and we have satisfied the definition of an accumulation point for $L$.

##### Lemma 4.29*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ be a set. If $x \in S'$, then there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ that satisfies $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

By the definition of an accumulation point $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ is nonempty for all $\varepsilon>0$. Notice that this set is equivalent to $N_{\varepsilon}(x)\cap S\setminus \{ x \}$. Thus for any epsilon we can produce a $y \in S\setminus \{ x \}$ in that epsilon neighborhood. Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists y_{1}|y_{1} \in N_{1}(x) \\
&\exists y_{2}|y_{2} \in N_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) \\
&\exists y_{3}|y_{3} \in N_{\frac{1}{3}}(x) \\
&\vdots\\
&\exists y_{n}|y_{n} \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x) \\
\end{align}
$
Where every $y_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (Notice that every $y_{n}$ does not have to be distinct; the function will just not be 1-1).

Now consider the sequence $a_{n}=y_{n}$. Because every $y_{n} \in S\setminus \{ x \}$, $a_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$. We now have to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. 

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|Theorem 1.3]] we can produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<\varepsilon$. Consider any $a_{m}$ such that $m>N$. $a_{m} \in N_{\frac{1}{m}}(x)\subseteq N_{\frac{1}{N}}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}$. Thus for every $m>N$ $\left| a_{m}-x \right|<\varepsilon$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

##### Corollary 4.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $p \in cl(T)$ if and only if there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $T$ such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} = p$.

First we will show the forward direction: If $p \in cl(T)$ then there exists a sequence such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$. [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] guarantees that if $p \in S'$ then we can produce such a sequence. Thus we only have to consider the case where $p \in S$, which is trivial because obviously the sequence $a_{n}=p,\forall n \in N$ converges to $p$.

[[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] Proves the backward direction.

##### Theorem 4.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

Forward direction: If $S$ is closed, then every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] if $a_{n}$ converges, it must converge to an element in $S\cup S'=cl(S)$, but because $S$ is closed $cl(S)=S$, and thus $a_{n}$ must converge to an element in $S$.

Backward direction: If every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\in S$, then $S$ is closed.

Let $x \in S'$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (and thus also in $S$), such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. By our assumption this means that $x \in S$. Thus we have proved that $S'\subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed.

Similarly, a sequence $c_{n}$ is said to diverge to negative infinity if and only if $\forall P<0,\exists M>0$ such that if $n\geq M$, then $c_{n}<P$.

##### Exercise 4.33

Let $P>0$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there exists an $N$ such that $N>P^{2}\to \sqrt{ N }>P$. Thus for all $n\geq N$, $\sqrt{ n }>P$, and $\sqrt{ n }$ diverges to $\infty$.

### Chapter 5

#### 5.1 Preliminary Work

##### Defintion 5.1
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **Cauchy** if and only if for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $M>0$ such that $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ for all integers $n,m\geq M$.

##### Exercise 5.2
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$ is a Cauchy sequence.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we can produce an $M>0$ such that for all $n>M$ $\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|<\varepsilon$. Let $m>M$ as well. Because $\frac{1}{m}$ is positive and less than $\frac{1}{n}$, $\left| \frac{1}{n} -\frac{1}{m}\right|<\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|<\varepsilon$. Thus $\frac{1}{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L \in \mathbb{R}$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

Let $M$ be a number such that for $\forall n>M$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, and suppose that $n$ and $m$ are both greater than $M$.

$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| &=\left| (a_{n}-L)+(L-a_{m}) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-L \right| +\left| L-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus for any $n,m>M$, $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ and so $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If a sequence is Cauchy, then it is bounded

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

There exists an $M>0$ such that for all $n,m>M$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon  
\end{align}
$
Let $n$ be fixed and set $a_{n}=A$.
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{m}-A \right| &<\varepsilon  \\
a_{m}-A&<\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&<\varepsilon+A \\
\left| A-a_{m} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
A-a_{m}&<\varepsilon \\ 
a_{m}-A&>-\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&>A-\varepsilon
\end{align}
$

Thus $A-\varepsilon$ is a lower bound and $A+\varepsilon$ is an upper bound for every element after $a_{M}$. The sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{M}$ is finite and thus must be bounded above by some number $B$ and bounded below by $-B$. Thus $min\{ A-\varepsilon,-B \}$ must be a lower bound for the whole sequence, and $max\{ A+\varepsilon,B \}$ must be an upper bound for the whole sequence.

If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is called a **subsequence** of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$. If a subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L_{1}$ then we say that $L_{1}$ is a **subsequential limit** of the original sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$.

##### Exercise 5.7

In the first case the subsequence is strictly increasing (the denominators are always going up), while in the second case it is not.

##### Exercise 5.8

1. $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{8}= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{7}{11}, \frac{1}{8}$
2. $(a_{2k})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{6},\dots$ This seems like it will approach 0.
3. $(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{7}{11},\dots$ This seems to be approaching $\frac{1}{2}$.

##### Lemma 5.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $m_{k}\geq k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by induction.

Base case: $k=1$. if $m_{k}$ is in the natural numbers then it must be $\geq1=k$. Thus the base case is verified.

Induction hypothesis: Assume that for some natural number $k$, $m_{k}\geq k$. We must then show that $m_{k+1}\geq k+1$. This is very straightforward to verify because $m_{k}$ is strictly increasing.

#### 5.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 5.10
> [!none]

Forward direction: If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$, then all of the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ as well.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value. There must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$. Every $a_{m_{k}}$ where $m_{k}>N$ must be within this epsilon range as well, making it convergent.

Backward direction: If all the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must as well.
This proof is trivial, because $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a subsequence of itself.

##### Theorem 5.11
> [!none]

This is just applying the theorem above?

##### Lemma 5.12 (Monotone Subsequence Lemma)
> [!none]

Let $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. We will call a term $a_{M}$ a **dominant term** if and only if $a_{M}>a_{n}$ for all $n>M$.

There must either be a finite amount of dominant terms for $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or an or an infinite amount.

If there is an infinite number of dominant terms, then the subsequence $\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ of dominant terms will be decreasing by definition of a dominant term.

If there is a finite amount of dominant terms there must exists a greatest dominant term (greatest not in value, but in its placement in the sequence), $a_{N}$. Thus for all $n>N$, $a_{n}$ cannot be a dominant term. By negating the definition of a dominant term, we get the following fact:

> [!none] 
> For every $n>N$  there must exists an $m>n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_{m}\geq a_{n}$.

Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists m_{1}>N+1:a_{m_{1}}\geq a_{N+1}\\
&\exists m_{2}>m_{1}:a_{m_{2}}\geq a_{m_{1}}\\
&\exists m_{3}>m_{1}:a_{m_{3}}\geq a_{m_{2}}\\
&\vdots\\
&\exists m_{k}>m_{k-1}:a_{m_{k}}\geq a_{m_{k-1}}\\
\end{align}
$
Thus if we set $\{ a_{n_{k}} \}=\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ by construction the sequence will be increasing and thus monotone.

In both the case where there are a finite number of dominant terms, and in the case where there is an infinite number, we can produce a monotone sequence.

##### Theorem 5.13 (Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence.

Combining the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem|#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem]] with [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma|#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma]] gives us the desired result.

##### Lemma 5.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})$ has a convergent subsequence, then $a_{n}$ must converge.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value and $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a convergent subsequence within $(a_{n})$.
$
\exists N_{1}|\forall k>N_{1}  \left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$
$
\exists N_{2}\forall n,m>N\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$

Let $k>N_{1}$ and $n,m>N_{2}$.
$
\left| a_{n}-L \right| \leq \left| a_{n}-a_{m_{k}} \right| +\left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon.
$

##### Theorem 5.15 (Cauchy Criterion)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

1. Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. (Easy to prove the same way we did for convergent sequences in [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 4 26|#Exercise 4 26]]).
2. Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences]])
3. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence.
4. Every Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges ([[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 14|#Lemma 5 14]]).
5. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

### Chapter 1

#### 1.1 Preliminary Work
##### Axiom 1.1
> [!none] 
> $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[Ordered field|Ordered field]].

##### Axiom 1.2 (The Archimedean Principle)
> [!none] 
> For every number $b\in \mathbb{R}$, there is some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ that is larger than $b$.

##### Theorem 1.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  For any positive number $\epsilon$, there exists a number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than $\epsilon$.

Pick a $\delta>0$ such that $\frac{1}{\delta}=\epsilon$. The AP gives that for some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$
$
\begin{align}
n&>\delta \\
\frac{1}{n}&< \frac{1}{\delta} = \epsilon
\end{align}
$

##### Axiom 1.4 (The Well Ordering Principle for $\mathbb{N}$)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ as a least element

##### Theorem 1.5 (The Principle of Mathematical Induction)
> [!none] 
> - [x] 
> Consider a statement $P(N)$ that is defined for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that 
> 1. $P(1)$ is true, and
> 2. for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, if $P(n)$ is true then $P(n+1)$ is true.
> 
> Then $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose the hypotheses are true, but the conclusion is false.

Consider the set $S:=\{ n\in\mathbb{N}|P(n) \text{ is false} \}$. By our initial assumption this set cannot be empty. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well-Ordering Principle for mathbb N|Well-Ordering Principle]] this set has a least element $l$. $P(l-1)$ must be true, otherwise $l-1$ would be in the set, and $l$ would not be the least element. But if $l-1$ is true, then by our first assumption, $P(l-1+1)=P(l)$ must be true. Therefore $P(l)$ is must true, and false (because it is in $S$), giving us our contradiction.

##### Definition 1.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are nonempty sets. Then $A$ is said to be **equinumerous** with $B$ iff there exists a bijection $f:A\to B$. In this case we write $A \sim B$ and say that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality.

##### Definition 1.7
> [!none]
> A set $S$ is said to be **finite** if and only if $S=\emptyset$ or $S \sim \{ 1,\dots ,n\}$, we say that $S$ is **finite with** $n$ **elements** and write $\left| S \right|=n$, where $\left| S \right|$ is referred to as the number of elements in the finite set $S$.

##### Exercise 1.8
> [!none] 
> - [x] Explicity show that the set $\{ North, East, South, West \}$ and the set $\{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ are equinumerous in the sense of [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 7|Definition 1.7]] (i.e., by constructing a bijection between the two sets). Do these sets satisfy definition 1.7 for some $n$?

Consider the function $f:\{ North, East, South, West \} \to \{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ s.t.
$
\begin{align}
f(North) &= 1 \\
f(East) &= 4 \\
f(South) &= 7 \\
f(West) &= 10
\end{align}
$
It is trivial to show that $f$ is a 1-1 and onto, and that both sets are equinumerous to the set $\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$.

##### Definition 1.9
> [!none] 
> Let $S$ be a set. Then the **power set of** $S$, denoted $P(S)$ is the set that contains all subsets of $S$.

##### Example 1.10
> [!none] 
> Consider the set $S=\{ 1,2 \}$ with two elements in it. Its power set, $P(S)=\{ \emptyset,\{ 1 \},\{ 2 \},\{ 1,2 \} \}$, is a set with four elements in it

##### Theorem 1.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let  $S$ be a set with $n$ elements in it. Then $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements in it.

If $S$ has one element in it $P(S)=S$, both of which have 1 element in them. When you add an element to any set, the new power set will be the old power set, plus every set in the old power set plus the new element. Thus every time we add a new element we double the elements in the power set. It is easy to show that these two facts, when combined, imply that $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements when $S$ has $n$ elements.

Alternatively, to construct any set we could iterate through every element of the set and either put it in the set, or not. This results in $2^{n}$ different ways we could construct the sets.

##### Definition 1.12
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **countably infinite** (or **denumerable**) if and only if $S \sim \mathbb{N}$. A set $S$ is said to be **countable** if and only if $S$ is finite or countably infinite.

##### Exercise 1.13
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Show that $2\mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{N}$ by identifying a bijection between them.

Consider the function $f:2\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(e) = \frac{e}{2}
\end{align}
$
for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ $f(2n)$ will map to $n$, ensuring that the function is onto. If $f(m)=f(n)$ then $2n=2m$, which implies $n=m$, showing that the function is also 1-1, and thus a bijection.

##### Theorem 1.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The sets $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality (or, put another way: $\mathbb{Z}$ is countably infinite).

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(n)&=\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)\qquad n \text{ is even} \\
f(n)&=-\frac{n-1}{2}\qquad n \text{ is odd}
\end{align}
$
For any positive integer $x$, $f(2x)$ will map to it ($2x$ is guaranteed to be a natural number). For any negative (or = 0) integer $y$, $f(-2y +1)$ will map to $y$. Therefore $f$ is onto.

Suppose $f(m)=f(n)$. WLG, if $m$ is odd, and $n$ is even, then we have:
$
\begin{align}
\frac{n}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
n&= -m+1 \\
n+m&= 1
\end{align}
$
But if both $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers their sum must be greater than $1$. Therefore one cannot be even and the other odd.

It's trivial to show the following equations are only true when $n=m$.

\begin{align}
-\frac{n-1}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\

$
Thus $f$ is 1-1 as well, making it a bijection.

#### 1.2 Main Theorems

##### Composition of Two Bijections Lemma
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ are bijections, then the composite function $f \circ g:A\to C$ will be a bijection as well.

This is a fact will be useful in multiple of the following proofs.

First we will prove that for bijections $f:X\to S$ and $g:S\to V$, $g\circ f:X \to V$ is a bijection as well. 

For every element $v\in V$ there exists an element in $x \in X$ such that maps to it (by the definition of $f$ being onto). For every $x$ there is an element $s \in S$ which maps to it, because $g$ is onto. Thus there exists an $s \in S$ that will map to any $v \in V$, so $g \circ f$ in onto.

Next, we must show that $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well.

If $g(f(n))=g(f(m))$ then because $g$ is 1-1, $f(n)=f(m)$. Because $f$ is 1-1 as well that implies $n=m$, so $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well as onto.



##### Theorem 1.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable

If $S\in\mathbb{N}$ is finite, then it is countable by definition.

The meat of the proof lies in proving that $S$ is countable when it is infinite. 

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to S$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(1) &= min(S) \\
f(2) &= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1) \}) \\
\vdots \\
f(n)&=min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(n-1) \})
\end{align}
$

We know that such minimum elements must exist because of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|well ordering principle]]. Our job is now to show that this function is both 1-1 and onto.

Consider the the following set where $x \in S$
$
S_{x}:=\{ y \in S|y\leq x \} 
$

Because this set is bounded below (Well Ordering Principle), and above (by x), it is finite, and thus has a cardinality.

For any $x \in S$ consider $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)$. The cardinality of $S_{x}$ is 1+ the number of elements less than $x$ in $S$ (the +1 is because $x$ is included in the set as well). Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|) = min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots f(\left| S_{x}-1 \right|) \})$ take the least element of the set $S$ with all the elements less than $x$ removed. Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)=x$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $x \in S$, $f$ is onto.

We will argue that $f$ is 1-1 by contradiction. If $f$ were not 1-1, then there exists an $n$ and $m$ such that $f(n)=f(m)$ and $n\neq m$. That implies that WLOG, $n<m$. $f(m)= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \})$. Because $n<m$ $f(n)$ must not be in the set $S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \}$. $f(m)$ must in in this set, because it is the least element of it. But $f(m)=f(n)$, so $f(n)$ is in this set. Thus we have our contradiction, showing that $f$ is 1-1.

Therefore, $f$ is 1-1 and onto, making it a bijection, and making the set $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every subset of a countable set is countable.

Suppose $X\subseteq S$ where $S$ is a countable set.
If a set $S$ is countable, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $\mathbb{N}\to S$. Consider the sets $\mathbb{N}':=\{ n \in \mathbb{N}|f(n) \in X \}$. If we use the same function $f$, but change the domain and codomain such that it goes from $\mathbb{N}'\to S$, it is not difficult to see that it is a bijection.

By construction the function is onto, and we already know that it is 1-1. Therefore there $f$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}'$ to $X$. But $\mathbb{N}'$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|Theorem 1.15]] $X$ must be countable as well.

##### Theorem 1.17
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $F$ is a collection of nonempty sets, then the equinumerous relation $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation on $F$.

To show that $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation we must show that it is reflexive ($A\sim A$), symmetric (if$A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$), and transitive (if $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$).

1. Reflexive—If we consider the function $f:A\to A$ for all $a\in A$ such that $f(a)= a$, checking that it is onto and 1-1 is trivial.
2. Symmetry—If $A\sim B$ then there exists a bijection $f$ from $A\to B$ for all $a\in A$, and $b\in B$. The inverse of a bijection is still a bijection, it is easy to verify that $f^{-1}$ is a bijection from $B\to A$. Thus implying that $B\sim A$.
3. Transitive—If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$ then there exists bijections $f$ and $g$ from $A\to B$ and from $B\to C$ respectively. Once again, it is straightforward to verify that the function $f \circ g$ is a bijection from $A \to C$, implying that $A \sim C$.

##### Theorem 1.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. If there exists an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:\mathbb{N} \to T$, then $T$ is countable.

Thus we have a bijection from $S$ to $f(S)$, which is a subset of of $N$. Thus 
First, we will consider the case where there is an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$. $f$ is already 1-1, and if we change the codomain to $f(S)$, then by definition it is onto as well. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|#Theorem 1 15]] because $f(S) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, $f(S)$ is countable. If $f(S)$ is finite it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite as well, and thus countable. If $f(S)$ is not countable then there is a bijection from $f(s)\to \mathbb{N}$.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because we have bijections from $S\to f(S)$ and from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$, there also exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, making $S$ countable.

Now we consider the case where there is a surjection $g:\mathbb{N}\to T$. Consider the class of sets $X_{t}:=\{ n \in\mathbb{N}|g(n)=t \}$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] $X_{t}$ will always have a least element. Thus we construct the set $N:=\{t\in T|min({ X_{t} })\}$. 

If we consider the same $g$, but tweak the domain to $N$ instead of $\mathbb{N}$, it will now be 1-1, because the least element of a set is unique. Thus it is both 1-1 and onto, giving a bijection from $N\to T$. Because $N \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ there is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to N$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because there are bijections from $\mathbb{N} \to N$ and from $N\to T$ there must also be a bijection from $N\to T$, making $T$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets with $T$ countable. If there exists an injection $f:S\to T$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:T\to S$, then $S$ is countable.

Consider the function $\hat{f}:S\to f(S)$ where the only difference between $f$ and $\hat{f}$ is their codomain. $\hat{f}$ is a bijection, and because $f(S)\subseteq T$, it must be countable ([[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]]). If $f(S)$ is finite, then it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite (and thus countable) as well. If $f(S)$ is not finite, then there exists a bijection between $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. Thus there is a bijection from $S\to f(S)$ as well as from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, thus making $S$ countable.

Consider the set $X_{s}:=\{t\in T|g(t)=s\}$. Now we construct the set $T':=\{min(X_{s})|s \in S\}$. Because the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] guarantees that there is only one least element, the function $\hat{g}:T'\to S$ is 1-1 as well as onto, making it a bijection. $T'\subseteq T$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]] $T'$ is countable. We now have a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to T'$ and from $T'\to S$. Thus by the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, making $S$ countable.

##### Lemma 1.20
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so are $A\cup  B$ and $A \times B$.

First we will prove that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $A$ and $B$ are countable there exists bijection $f$ and $g$ such that any element in $A$ or $B$ can be represented as
$
\displaylines{
a_{n}=f(n)\\
b_{n}=g(n)
}
$
Let's create a new function $h:\mathbb{N}\to A\cup B$
$
\begin{align}
h(n)&=a_{\frac{n}{2}}\qquad \text{n is even} \\
h(n)&=b_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\qquad \text{ n is odd}
\end{align}
$
By theorem [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 18|#Theorem 1 18]] we only must show that $h$ is onto in order to show that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $f$ and $g$ are countable we know any element in set $A$ can be represented as $a_{n}$ and any element in set $B$ can be represented as $b_{n}$. Thus any element of $A\cup B$ can be represented as either $a_{n}$ or $b_{n}$.

For an arbitrary $b_{n}$, $h(2n-1)$ will map to $b_{n}$. For an arbitrary $a_{n}$, $h(2n)$ will map to $a_{n}$. Thus the function is onto and we have proved that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Next we must prove that $A\times B$ is countable as well. We will again use the countability of $A$ and $B$ to represent an arbitrary element of them as $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ respectively.

I don't want to write out the whole rest of the proof, but the following picture should give a good idea that there is a bijection from $N\to A\cup B$.

Where $f(1)$ would be the first element hit by the purple arrow, $f(2)$ the second, and so on.

##### Theorem 1.21
> [!none] 
> - [>]  $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

To prove this we will invoke [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]] to say that $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is countable. Consider the function $f:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{N}^{2}$
$
f(q)=(a,b)\qquad \text{ Where a/b=q and is in lowest form}
$

If we show this function to be injective, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 19|#Corollary 1 19]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

Suppose there exists an two rational numbers such that where $q_{1}=\frac{a}{b}\neq \frac{x}{y}=q_{2}$, but $(a,b)=(x,y)$. The second statement, by definition, means that $a=x$ and $b=y$. but if that is true, then $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{x}{y}$ thus we have contradiction, meaning $f$ must be injective, and $\mathbb{Q}$ must be countable.

##### Theorem 1.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable

This proof is really beefy and I don't want to write it down. The skeleton in the book is very thorough and filling in the gaps should not be difficult.

##### Definition 1.23
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **uncountable** if and only if it is fails to satisfy [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 12|#Definition 1 12]]

In other words, for some set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is no bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, and the set is not finite.

##### Definition 1.24
> [!none] 
> If $p$ is an upper bound for a set $S$ and $p \in S$ then we say $p$ is a maximum element of $S$ (denoted $p=max(S)$). The definition for a minimum element is constructed similarly.

##### Definition 1.26
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above. A number $\alpha$ is a least upper bound for $S$ if and only if
> 1. $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $S$ and
> 2. if $y<\alpha$, then there exists some $x \in S$ such that $y<x\leq \alpha$.

Alternatively, for some number $\alpha$ to be the least upper bound for a set, then it must be both greater than or equal to every element in the set, and less than or equal to every other upper bound for $S$.

##### Exercise 1.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=\left\{  0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \dots \right\}$. Is $10$ an upper bound of $S$? Is $2$ an upper bound? What is the least upper bound for $S$? Does $S$ have a maximum element?

For all $n \in N$
$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n}&>0\\
-\frac{1}{n}&<0 \\
1-\frac{1}{n}&<1<10
\end{align}
$
Therefore $10$ is an upper bound for $S$. By the same argument $2$ is as well.

In the last step we showed that $1-\frac{1}{n}<1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $1$ is an upper bound for $S$. Consider any number $y<1$. by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\exists m \in \mathbb{N}| \frac{1}{m}<1-y$. Thus from rearranging that inequality we get
$
y<1-\frac{1}{m}
$
Because $m$ is a natural number, the term on the right will be an element of the set. Thus we have shown that for any $y<1$ there exists a number $>y$ and less than $1$ in $S$. Thus by the definition of a supremum $1$ is the least upper bound of $S$.

##### Lemma 1.28
> [!none] 
> If a nonempty set in $S$ has a least upper bound, then that least upper bound is unique. In other words, $S$ cannot have two different least upper bounds.

Suppose we have two numbers $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ that are least upper bounds for a set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We will argue that they must be the same number by contradiction. If they were not, then WLOG $x<y$. But $x$ is an upper bound, so $y$ cannot be the least upper bound if $x$ is less than it. Thus we have our contradiction and every least upper bound is unique.

##### Definition 1.29
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded below. A number $\beta$ is the **greatest lower bound** for $S$ (denoted $\beta =inf(S)$) if and only if
> 1. $\beta$ is a lower bound for $S$
> 2. if $z>\beta$, then there exists some $x \in S$ such that $\beta\leq x<z$. 

##### Axiom 1.30 (The Axiom of Completeness)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$. Equivalently: Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 1.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Why are the two statements of the Axiom of Completeness equivalent?

For some some $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded blow, consider the set $B:=\{b \in \mathbb{R}|\forall x \in S, b\leq x\}$. This set is bounded above by every element of $S$, so the Axiom of Completeness says $m=\text{ sup}(B)$ must exists. Because every element in $S$ is an upper bound for $B$, $m\leq S$. Because $B$ is the set of upper bounds for $S$, by definition of a least upper bound, $m>$ every bound for $S$. Thus is satisfies both the criteria to be greatest lower bound for $S$.

The exact same process can be carried out to show that if we assume a set bounded below has a greatest lower bound, then any set must have a greatest upper bound. Thus the two formulations of the Axiom of Completeness are the same.

##### Exercise 1.35
> [!none] 
> Prove or disprove: $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite

In this proof we will rely on the results of [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 22|#Theorem 1 22]], [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 21|#Theorem 1 21]], and [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]], which state, respectively, that
1. $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable,
2. $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, and
3. The union of two countable sets is countable as well.

We will prove that $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is not countable by contradiction. Assume that it is countable. Now consider the set $\mathbb{Q}\cup \mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$. Because both of these sets are countable, their union must be as well. But we know what their union is; by definition it must be $\mathbb{R}$, which is uncountable. Thus we have our contradiction and the irrationals must be uncountable.

##### Definition 1.36

4. Yes it is. For any natural number $n$, $0=0$ and $\frac{1}{n+1}< \frac{1}{n}$

##### Theorem 1.39 (The Nested Interval Property)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $\{ I_{n} \}$ is a collection of nested, nonempty intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{R}$. Then the collection $\{ I_{n} \}$ has a nonempty intersection—in other words, there exists $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p$ is an element of $I_{n}$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

Consider the set $A:=\{n \in \mathbb{N}| a_{n} \}$. We know that $b_{1}$ is an upper bound on this set, because for any $a_{n}$, $b_{n}$ is greater than it, and $b_{1}<b_{n}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}>1$. Thus we can invoke the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness|#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness]] and say that $a=\text{ sup}(A)$ exists.

By the definition of a supremum, $a\geq a_{n}$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$a$ must also be less than or equal to every $b_{n}$. To show this fact we must first prove that any $b_{k}$ is greater than $a_{i}$ $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. If this were not the case, and there were some $a_{i}$ such that $a_{i}>b_{k}$, then there must also be an $b_{i}$ such that $b_{i}>a_{i}$. But this would mean that all elements in the $i$th interval are greater than all elements in the $k$th interval, so neither could be a subset of the other. Thus every $b_{n}$ must be greater than every $a_{i}$. Using this fact, if $a>b_{k}$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then there would be another upper bound, $b_{k}$, which is less than $a$, contradicting the definition of a supremum.

Therefore
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n}\qquad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
$
By construction thus must mean that $a$ is in every interval $I_{n}$.

##### Exercise 1.40
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Note that the hypothesis in the statement of the Nested Interval Property includes the assumption that each interval looks like $[a_{n},b_{n}]$. Would the theorem be hold for other types of nonempty intervals?

Nothing would change in our argument until the last line. 
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n} \qquad \forall  n \in \mathbb{N}
$

But this only implies that $a$ must be in the set $[a_{n}, b_{n}]$ *because the endpoints are included*. If instead it was in the form $(a_{n},b_{n}]$, or $(a_{n},b_{n})$, then we could have $a=a_{n}$, which would satisfy the inequality above, but not be included in those sets.

Consider the intervals $I_{n}=$ $\left( 0, \frac{1}{n} \right]$. For any number there will always be a $\frac{1}{n}$ smaller than it ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]]), so there will be a set it is not included in. This is only possible because the supremum of the left endpoints = 0, and because they are open intervals $0$ is not included in any of them.

##### Example 1.41
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ represent the trunction of $\pi$to $n$ decimal places, and let $b_{n}=a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}$. Then define $J_{n}=[a_{n},b_{n}]$. It follows that

> Show that $J_{1}\subseteq J_{2}\subseteq J_{3}\dots$ Now define $I_{n}=J_{n}\cap \mathbb{Q}$. In a world consisting of only rational numbers, $\{ I_{n} \}$ constitutes a collection of nonempty, nested intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{Q}$. Does it follow that there is some number $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p$ is an element in **every** $I_{n}$?

For any natural number $n$, $\frac{1}{10^{n}}>0$, so $a_{n}<b_{n}$. $a_{n+1}$ must be greater than $a_{n}$ (or, if the next decimal is 0, equal to $a_{n}$), because it is just $a_{n}$ plus the next decimal. $b_{n+1}=a_{n+1}+\frac{1}{10^{n+1}}<a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}=b_{n}$. Therefore each successive interval must be a subset of the last.

No, it does not imply that there will be a rational number $p$ that is in the intersection of every one of these sets. The Nested Interval Property only implies that there will be a **real number** such that it is in the intersection of all of the sets.

> [!none] 
> - [x]  Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number.

We must show that for any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ where $a<b$ there exists a rational number $q$ such that $a<q<b$.

First, consider the case where $0\leq a<b$.

From [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we know that there exists a $n \in \mathbb{N}|$ $0<\frac{1}{n} < \left| b-a \right|$. Let $q=\frac{1}{n}$, where $q$ is clearly rational.

Consider the set $S=\{n \in \mathbb{N}|b\leq n\cdot q\}$. Because $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] allows us to produce an $m =min(S)$. $m-1$ must not be in $S$, otherwise $m$ would not be the least element of $S$ (we are guaranteed that it is in the naturals because $q<b$, so 1 cannot be the least element, thus $m-1\geq1$). By the construction of $S$ this implies that $(m-1)\cdot q <b$. 

$m$ must be in $S$, by the definition of a least element. This implies $mq\geq  b$.
$
\begin{align}
mq&\geq b \\
mq-q&\geq b-q>b-(b-a) \qquad \text{because }q<b-a\\ 
(m-1)q&>a
\end{align}
$
Therefore we have $a<(m-1)q<b$. Because $q$ is rational and $m-1$ is a natural number, $(m-1)q$ must be rational as well, and we have thus proved for any $0\leq a<b$ there is a rational number in between $a$ and $b$.

The case where $a<0<b$ is trivial because by construction $0$ a rational number within the interval.

Lastly we consider the case where $a<b\leq0$. Consider the interval between $-b$ and $-a$. Because $a,b$ are negative, $-a,-b$ must be positive and so we can use our previous work to produce a number $q \in Q|-b<q<-a$. negating this inequality produces $a<-q<b$, which is the desired result.

Thus for any $a$ and $b$ there will always be a rational number in between them.

##### Exercise 1.51*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $a<b$, then the open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] each of them will produce a unique rational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of rationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Corollary 1.52*
> [!none] 
> - [x] Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one irrational number.

We will prove this statement by contradiction. Assume it is false, and there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that in between them there are **no** irrational numbers. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there exists a $b \in \mathbb{Q}|a<q<b$. Consider an arbitrary $x \in (a-q,b-q)$.
$
\begin{align}
a-q&<x<b-q \\
a&<x+q<b
\end{align}
$
Therefore $x+q \in (a,b)$ and by our initial assumption $x+q$ is rational. But $q$ is rational, so $(x+q)-q=x$ must be rational as well. Thus all elements in the set $(a-q,b-q)$ are rational. From now on let $a'=a-q$ and $b'=b-q$.

Now consider the interval $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$, for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $s \in (n\cdot a', n\cdot b')$
$
\begin{align}
n\cdot a' < s < n\cdot b' \\
a'< \frac{s}{n}<b'
\end{align}
$
Therefore $\frac{s}{n} \in (a',b')$ and is rational. But if $\frac{s}{n}$ is rational, then $\frac{s}{n} \cdot n=s$ must be rational as well. Thus any element of an interval of the form $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ will be rational.

Here we will take a moment to remember that
$
\begin{align}
a&<q<b \\
a'=a-q&<0<b-q=b'
\end{align}
$
$n$ is any arbitrary natural number, so as we increase $n$ it will have the effect of scaling up this interval to any desired size while keeping all its members rational. This allows us to show that irrational numbers don't exist, which is obviously false. But for the sake of precision let us take a specific natural number for our contradiction.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there will be an $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m> \frac{3}{b'}$. Therefore $b' \cdot m >3$. $m\cdot b'>3>\sqrt{ 3 }$, and $\sqrt{ 3 }>0>a'\cdot m$. This implies that $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is in the interval $(m\cdot a',m\cdot b')$, making it rational. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 32|#Theorem 1 32]] $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational, giving us our contradiction and completing the proof.

##### Exercise 1.53*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  if $a<b$, then the interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many irrational number.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 52|#Exercise 1 52]] each of them will produce a unique irrational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of irrationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Exercise 1.54 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove that if $z$ is an upper bound for $A$, and $z \in A$, then it must be true that $z=sup(A)$.

- Because $z$ is already established as an upper bound, the only thing which we have to show is that $z\leq b$, where $b$ is any other upper bound.
- We will prove by contradiction
- Assume there is an upper bound $b<z$ outside of the set. But since $z$ is in the set it is not an upper bound. Therefore we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.55*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Archimedean Principle was presented as an axiom. Show that, in fact, the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

Arch: For any b in the Real Numbers there exists a natural number $n > b$.

Axiom: For any nonempty subset of R which is bounded above there exists a least upper bound.

We will prove this by contradiction. Our initial assumption is that the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle, which is logically equivalent to the Archimedean Principle being true and the Axiom of Completeness being false.

Let us assume that the Axiom of Completeness is true and that the Archimedean Principle is not true.

That the Archimedean Principle is not true implies that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \ngtr b$. Then $b$ would be an upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$. By the Axiom of Completeness, $\mathbb{N}$ must have a least upper bound as it is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and it is bounded above.

Let us call this least upper bound $m$. If $m$ is a least upper bound, then $m - 1$ cannot be a bound to $\mathbb{N}$. Since $m - 1$ is not an upper bound, that implies that $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} | n > m - 1$. This in turn implies that $m < n + 1$. However, because the $\mathbb{N}$ are closed under addition, $n + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and because $m$ is now shown to be less than a natural number, it cannot be the least upper bound. This is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be false. That the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle is untrue. We have therefore proven that the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

##### Exercise 1.56*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Axiom of Completeness stipulates, in a very specific way, that the set of real number, $\mathbb{R}$, completes the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$. To appreciate this, suppose that you are working in a number universe consisting of only rational numbers. Show that there does exist a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $S$ has a rational upper bound and yet $S$ has no rational least upper bound.

Consider the set $S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} | x \cdot x < 2\}$.

Let us find the least upper bound $s$ of the set $S$. We propose $\sqrt{2}$ as $s$, and will show that both $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ and that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

First let us demonstrate that $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ with a proof by contradiction. Suppose $\exists x \in S | x > \sqrt{2}$. Then $x^{2} > 2$, and by the definition of $S$, $S$ cannot contain $x$. Thus, our initial assumption must be false, and $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$.

Second let us demonstrate that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$, also with a proof by contradiction. Let us then suppose that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | b < s$. Then by the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ proved in exercise 1.5, we know that $\exists n \in \mathbb{Q} | b < n < s$. From this we know that $n^{2} < s^{2}$, or that $n^{2} < 2$. Since $n \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $n^{2} < 2$, by definition of $S$, $n \in S$. Because $n \in S$ and $n > b$, $b$ cannot be an upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; therefore $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

Therefore, $s = \sqrt{2}$ is the least upper bound of $S$. It should be clear that $S$ has no end of rational upper bounds; however $S$ has a irrational least upper bound.

##### Exercise 1.57*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose that $p$ is a prime number. Show that there is no rational number $z$ that satifies $z^{2}=p$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose there is a $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\frac{a}{b} = z$ and $z^{2}=p$, and $\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest form.
$
\begin{align}
\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{2} &= p \\
a^{2} &= pb^{2}
\end{align}
$
From this statement we can see that $p$ is a factor of $a$. If it were not then $a^{2}$ would not have it as a factor either, which it clearly does. Thus we can write $a = px$, where $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
$
\begin{align}
(px)^{2} &= pb^{2} \\
px^{2} &= b^{2}
\end{align}
$
By the same argument we can see that $p$ is also a factor of $b$. But if $p$ is a factor of both $b$ and $a$, then $\frac{a}{b}$ is not in lowest form, and we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.58*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $p$ is a positive number. Use the Axiom of Completeness to show that there is a number $z \in\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $z^{2}=p$.

Let $s$ be the least upper bound of the set $S=\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^{2} < p\}$.

Let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$. We begin by assuming that $s^{2} < p$.

Consider $(s + \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s + \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon < 1$, $\epsilon^{2} < \epsilon$, and since $p > s$:

$
\begin{gather*}
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1)
\end{gather*}
$

Let us now choose an $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2}$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2} \\
	s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p
\end{gather*}
$

From our initial comparison $s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon$ and $s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p$ we may conclude that $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$.

Since $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$, $(s + \epsilon) \in S$ and $(s + \epsilon) > s$. Therefore, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$ and we have run into a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong and $s^{2} \nless p$.

Now let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \ngtr p$. Let us then initially assume that $s^{2} > p$.

Consider $(s - \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s - \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon$, $s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon$. Let us then choose an $\epsilon$ such that $s \epsilon < s^{2} - p$. Then $s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$, $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$, $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ by the definition of $S$. Since $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ and it is smaller than $s$, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be incorrect and $s^{2} \ngtr p$.

Since we have shown through contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$ and $s^{2} \ngtr p$, $s^{2}$ must equal $p$. Thus $s$ is a real number which satisfies $s^{2} = p$.

##### Exercise 1.59 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $S$ is a bounded nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Define the related set $T =\{ -x|x \in S \}$. Prove that $T$ is bounded and that $\text{sup}(T)=-\text{inf}(S)$ and $\text{inf}(T)=-\text{sup}(S).$

- Show that $-\text{inf(S)}$ is an upper bound for T
- Show that the negative of the set of all the lower bounds of T is the same as the set of all of the upper bounds for t. 
- Show that the negative of every lower bound  is an upper bound.
- Since inf(T) is greater than every lower bound the negative of both with mean -inf(T) is less than every upper bound.
- Thus it is both greater than every element in the set, and it is less than every bound, making it = sup(T).

##### Exercise 2.2
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $a<b$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $S=(a,b)$. Prove that for each $c \in S$, there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(c)\subseteq S$. (Is this true if we used $S=(a,b]$?)

Let $\epsilon = min\left\{  \frac{\left| c-a \right|}{2}, \frac{\left| b-c \right|}{2}  \right\}$. 
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $a$:
$
c-\frac{c-a}{2}=\frac{c}{2} + \frac{a}{2}> \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}>a \\
$
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $b$:
$
c+ \frac{b-c}{2}=\frac{b}{2}+\frac{c}{2}< \frac{b}{2}+\frac{b}{2}=b
$
From these cases it is clear that $\forall x \in N_{\epsilon}$ will be inside $S$. This is not true for the interval $S=(a,b]$ because $b+\epsilon>b$ for any value of $\epsilon>0$.

2. If $\epsilon<12$: $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)$ and $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in S$. If $\epsilon\geq 12$: $3.99\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)$ and $3.99 \in S$

For any $2>\epsilon>0$ the point $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in (0,2]$. If $\epsilon\geq2$ the point $1 \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $1 \in (0,2]$. Therefore, by definition $2$ is an accumulation point of the set $(0,2]$

##### Exercise 2.8

Given an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there will be a rational number in between the interval $(\pi,\epsilon)\subseteq N_{\epsilon}^{*}(\pi )$.

##### Exercise 2.9 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  What does it mean for a point p to not be an accumulation point of a set $S$? Show that neither $2$ nor $\pi$ are accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

It means that there exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that there are no points in the set within that $\epsilon$ radius of $p$.

For example, take $\epsilon=0.1$. There are no integers in the sets $(1.9,2.1)\text{ \\ }\{ 2 \}$ or the set $(\pi-0.1,\pi+0.1)\text{ \\ }\{ \pi \}$. Thus they are no accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

##### Exercise 2.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that $S$ is closed if and only if $S'\subseteq S$.

Proof by contradiction: If this were false there would be an element $x \in S'$ and $x \cancel{ \in } S$ and $S$ would have to be closed. This would mean that $x \in S\cup S'$, but we have already established that $x$ is not in $S$, therefore $S\neq S\cup S'$, meaning it is not closed, and we have a contradiction.

##### Theorem 2.15
> [!none]
> - [>]  Let $A,B\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $(A\cup B)'$, then $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$.

We will prove by contraposition. The above statement is logically equivalent to: if $x \notin A'$ and $x \notin B'$, then $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

By the definition of $x$ not being in $A'$, there exists a $\epsilon$ such that $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap A$ is an empty set. Likewise there must exists a $\delta$ such that $N_{\delta }^{*}(x)\cap B$ is empty as well. WLOG $\delta<\epsilon$. Because $N_{\delta}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\epsilon  }^{*}(x)$ there are no points from $A$ *or* $B$ that are in the deleted delta-neighborhood of $x$. This is is essentially the definition of what it means for $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

##### Corollary 2.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of two closed sets is closed.

Let $A$ and $B$ both be closed sets. For any $x \in (A\cup B)'$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 15|#Theorem 2 15]] $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$. But because $A$ and $B$ are closed $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$, and thus $A',B' \subseteq A\cup B$, and $x \in A\cup B$. This shows that $(A\cup B)'\subseteq A\cup B$, which by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] makes $A\cup B$ closed.

##### Lemma 2.16.1
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $(a,b)\cap S'$ is nonempty, then $(a,b)\cap S$ is nonempty as well

From the hypothesis of the statement, we know there exists an element $x \in (a,b)$ and $x \in S'$. Because $x \in S'$ there must then exists $y \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ for all $\epsilon>0$. Let $c=min(\{ \left| b-x \right|,\left| x-a \right| \})$. Consider an $\epsilon|\epsilon<c$. $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)=(x-c,x+c)$. By the construction of $c$, $x-c\geq a$ and $x+c\leq b$. This implies that $y$ must be in $(a,b)$. Thus we have produced an element $y \in (a,b)\cap S$.

##### Theorem 2.17
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Given any set $S$, the set $S'$ is a closed set

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] we must show that $S''\in S'$. This means that if $y \in S''$, for an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ we must produce an element $x$ such that $x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$.

By definition of $y \in S''$, $\forall \delta >0$ $N_{\delta}^{*}(y)\cap S'\neq \emptyset$. Let $\delta=\epsilon$ in this case. Because the set is nonempty we can product an element $z$ inside of it. By construction this $z \in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon)$ and $z \in S'$. Because $z \in S'$ we can produce an $x$ such that for an arbitrary $\alpha$, $N_{\alpha}^{*}(z)\cap S\neq \emptyset$. Because $\delta$ is arbitrary, if we set it $=min\{ \left| (y+\epsilon) -z \right|, \left| z- (y-\epsilon) \right| \}$ $x$ is guaranteed to be in the interval $(y-\epsilon, y+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because $x$ must also be in $S$ we have assured that for an arbitrary $\epsilon$ $\exists x|x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$. Thus that set is not empty and we have accomplished our goal.

##### Corollary 2.18
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Given a set $S \subseteq  R$, the set $cl(S)$ is a closed set.

By definition $cl(S):=S\cup S'$. Given any accumulation point of $cl(S)'$ we must show that it is in $cl(S)$ ([[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). If $y \in cl(S)'$ then for all $\epsilon>0$ there $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap(S\cup S')$ must be nonempty. This is logically equivalent to $(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S)\cup(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')\neq \emptyset$. This means that there exists a $z$ such that $z \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ *or* $z \in (N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')$. If the first case is true, then by definition $y \in S'$. In the second case, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 2 16 1|#Lemma 2 16 1]] $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ must be nonempty, which again by definition makes $y \in S'$. Thus we have showed that for any point in $cl(S)'$, it must also be in $cl(S)=S\cup S'$, and by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]], it must be closed

##### Theorem 2.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of a finite number of closed sets is a closed set.

We must show that for any natural number $n\leq2$ the union of $n$ closed sets are closed.

Base case: for $n=2$, we simply have to refer to [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]].

Inductive hypothesis: Suppose that the union of $n$ closed sets is closed. We must show that the union of $n+1$ sets is closed.

By the inductive hypothesis for any sequence of closed sets $\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}$ is closed. $\cup_{i=2}^{n+1}C_{i}=\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}\cup C_{n+1}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]] this must also be closed, and by mathematical induction the union of any finite set of closed intervals will be closed as well.

##### Theorem 2.20
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The intersection of any collection of closed sets is a closed set.

Suppose $\{S_{i}\}$ is a collection of closed sets, either finite or infinite. We must show that if for all values of $i$ $S_{i}$ will be closed, then the intersection of all of these sets is closed. We will do this through contradiction. 

Assume that the theorem is false, and there exists a collection of sets $S_{i}$ which are all closed, yet their intersection (denoted $\cap S_{i}$) is not closed. $\cap S_{i}$ not being closed implies that $(\cap S_{i})'\nsubseteq\cap S_{i}$ (by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). Thus
$
\begin{align}
\exists x &\in (\cap S_{i})'|x \notin S_{i}, \text{ where }S_{i}\text{ is at least one of the sets}\\
\forall \epsilon&>0(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap(\cap S_{i})\neq \emptyset)
\end{align}
$
This implies that for any $S_{i}$, $N_{\epsilon^{*}}(x)\cap S_{i}\neq0$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point for every $S_{i}$. Because each $S_{i}$ is closed this guarantees that $x \in S_{i}$, for all $S_{i}$ as well, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]'s formulation of the definition of being closed. But this contradicts what we said earlier, finishing our proof.

##### Exercise 2.30*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if every nonempty interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.

Let $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. From the definition of dense, we know that $\mathbb{R}\subseteq\text{cl}(S)$, or equivalently, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. This means that every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is either an element of $S$ or is an accumulation point of $S$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $x\in\mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $S$, then we know that $(a,b)$ contains an element of $S$. If $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, then we know for some $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. In other words, the deleted neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one element of $S$. If $\epsilon<\text{min}\{|x-a|,|x-b|\}$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\subseteq (a,b)$. This means that at least one element of $S$ is also in $(a,b)$.

Therefore, if $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, then every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.


Suppose now that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S. This means for some distinct $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ where $\epsilon>0$ and some distinct $x\in\mathbb{R}$, the intervals $(x-\epsilon,x)$ and $(x,x+\epsilon)$ will each contain an element of $S$.

We can see that $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^*(x)$, and since there is at least two elements of $S$ in $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. This means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.

Since every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be described as an accumulation point of $S$, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. Therefore if every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S, then $S$ is dense in $R$.
 
##### Corollary 2.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  $Q$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

In order for $\mathbb{Q}$ to be dense in $\mathbb{R}$, it must be the case that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, since between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number. This means every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 2.38*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use induction to prove that $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, each of length $(\frac{1}{3})^{n}$.

Base case: $C_{0}$ is the closed interval $[0,1]$ which clearly has length $1=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{0}$ , and there is only one interval ($1=2^{0}$). Thus the base case checks out.

Inductive hypothesis: We assume that $C_{n}$ has a $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, and we must show that $C_{n+1}$ has $2^{n+1}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

In definition of the Cantor set we were told that to construct the next "partial Cantor set" set you take each interval of the previous set and remove the open third of the interval. When you do this you split each interval into two intervals, doubling the number of intervals. Thus if $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, $C_{n+1}$ will have $2^{n}\cdot2=2^{n+1}$ intervals. When the middle third of each interval is removed the split intervals will have $\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the interval they were split from. So if each interval in $C_{n}$ has length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, then each interval in $C_{n+1}$ will have length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified, and by induction for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $C_{n}$ will have $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

##### Exercise 2.39*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Find at least three distinct points in the Cantor Set.

When we remove the middle third of each interval the endpoints of each interval are never removed. Thus an endpoint for $C_{n}$ will be an endpoint for every $C_{m}$ where $m>n$. In addition, because every $C_{n}$ is a subset of every $C_{l}$ where $l<n$, every endpoint of $C_{n}$ will be contained in $C_{l}$. Thus any endpoint of any of the sets will be in the Cantor set. Consider the set $\left\{  0,1, \frac{1}{3}  \right\}$. All the elements in the set are endpoints of $C_{1}$, so they must be in the Cantor set.

##### Exercise 2.40*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor Set is a closed set.

Every $C_{n}$ is a union of a finite number of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]] every $C_{n}$ is closed. Because $C_{\infty}$ is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, which are all closed, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $C_{\infty}$ must be closed as well.

##### Exercise 2.41*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor set is nowhere **dense**.

To be nowhere dense there must be no $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. We will prove this by contradiction.

Assume there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. Because the Cantor set is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, $(a,b)$ must be a subset of every $C_{n}$. Let $c= \left| a-b \right|$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] for some natural number $m$, $\frac{1}{m}<c$. $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{m}< \frac{1}{m}$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $C_{n}$ it will be made up of intervals of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. Thus we can produce a $C_{m}$ which is the union of a disjoint set of intervals, each of which are smaller than $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)$ cannot be a subset of $C_{m}$, otherwise $C_{m}$ would contain an interval larger than $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. This is contradiction, showing that our initial assumption is false, and the Cantor set must be **nowhere dense**.

### Chapter 3

#### 3.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 3.1
> [!none] 
> Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. A point $p \in S$ is said to be an interior point of $S$ if and only if there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(p)\subseteq S$. The set of all interior points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as the interior of $S$) will be denoted by $S^{\circ}$.

##### Definition 3.2
> [!none] 
> A point $q \in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}(q)$ contains at least one element of $S$ and at least one element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. The set of all boundary points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as **the boundary of $S$**) will be denoted by $\partial(S)$.

##### Exercise 3.3 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For a set $S \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\partial (S)=\partial (\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

If $T= \mathbb{R}\setminus S$, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus T=S$. For every boundary point no matter how small of an interval around that point there is there must be an element of $S$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But any element of $S$ is an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus T$, and every element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is an element of $T$. Therefore the point must be a boundary point for $T=\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well. Showing the implication the other way is very simple.

##### Exercise 3.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $S'$ is a subset of $\partial(S)$.

This is false. Consider the set $(0,1)$. $\frac{1}{2}$ is an accumulation point, but not a boundary point.

##### Exercise 3.5
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $\partial(S)$ is a subset of $S'$.

This is also false. Consider the set $\{ 1 \}$. In this set $1$ is a boundary point, but not an accumulation point. I believe if the definition of a boundary point was a deleted epsilon neighborhood instead of a regular epsilon neighborhood, then this would be true.

##### Exercise 3.6

	4. $cl(S)=S\cup \{ 1 \}$
	5. $S$ is not closed because $S\neq cl(S)$.

##### Exercise 3.7

	2. $(S')'=\emptyset$
	3. $\partial(\partial(S))=S\cup \{ 1 \}$

##### Definition 3.8
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is said to be an **open set** if and only if $S^{\circ}=S$.

##### Theorem 3.9
> [!none] 
> - [>]  An interval of the form $(a,b):=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}|a<x<b \}$ is an open set.

The definition of an interior point makes it clear that it must be an element of the set. Thus we only have to show that $(a,b)\subseteq (a,b)^{\circ}$.

For any point $x \in (a,b)$, if you take $\varepsilon=min\{ \left| x-a \right|,\left| b-x \right| \}$, then the interval $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will be contained in the set, making $x$ an interior point of $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)=(a,b)^{\circ}$.

##### Exercise 3.10
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Consider the sets defined in Exercise 3.6. Which of these sets, if any, are open?

1. $S=[-1,4)$
	1. Not open. $1\in S$, but $1 \notin S^{\circ}$.
2. $S=[0,5]\cup \mathbb{Q}$
	1. Not open. $5 \in S$, but $5 \notin S^{\circ}$ .
3. $S=\mathbb{Z}$
	1. Not open. $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, but $1 \notin S^{\circ}$
4. $S=\left\{  \frac{n-1}{n}|n \in\mathbb{N}  \right\}$
	1. Not open. $\frac{3}{4} \in S$, but $\frac{3}{4} \notin S^{\circ}$.

##### Exercise 3.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: the set $\mathbb{R}$, as well as the empty set $\emptyset$, are both open and closed.

We will prove this statement true.

The empty set has no interior points, so it is equal to its interior, making it technically open. It also has no accumulation points, so they must be a subset of the set, making it also closed.

For any real number, any open interval containing the number will be a subset of the real numbers. This makes every real number part of the interior of $\mathbb{R}$, and thus making it open. Every accumulation point of $\mathbb{R}$ must be in $\mathbb{R}$, making it closed as well. 

##### Exercise 3.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $T$ is not open, then $T$ is closed.

We will prove this false. Consider the set $(0,1]$. This set is not open, but it is also not closed, providing a counterexample to the statement.

#### 3.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 3.13
> [!none] 
> - [>]  A set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. In other words, a set $S$ is open if and only if no boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

First we prove the forward direction: If $S$ is open, then all of the boundary are not elements of $S$.

For any $x \in \partial(S)$ by definition for all $\varepsilon>0$ the neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain a point in $S$ and a point not is $S$. Thus $N_{\varepsilon}$ cannot be a subset of $S$ because it contains an element not in $S$, meaning the point is not in the interior of $S$.

Next we prove the backward direction: If no boundary points are elements of $S$, then $S$ is an open set.

We will prove this by contraposition. The following statement is logically equivalent to the problem statement: If $S$ is not open, then there exists a boundary point which is an element of $S$.

If $S$ is not open that means there exists a point $x \in S|x \notin S^{\circ}$. Therefore for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain an element not in $S$. But because $x \in S$ it contains both a point in $S$, and a point not in $S$, making it a boundary point in $S$.

##### Lemma 3.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $S'\setminus S=\partial(S)\setminus S$.

Suppose $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain a point in $S$ because $x\in S'$. But because the neighborhood contains $x$, it also contains a point not in $S$. Thus it satisfies the criteria to be a boundary point and is not in $S$, so $x \in \partial(S)\setminus S$.

Now suppose $y$ is a boundary point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain one point in $S$ and one point not in $S$. Because $y \notin S$, the point in $S$ must be in $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$ this guarantees that $y \in S'$ by definition. We also know that $y \notin S$, so $y \in S'\setminus S$.

Because we have proved that $S'\setminus S\subseteq \partial(S)\setminus S$ and $\partial(S)\setminus S\subseteq S'\setminus S$, the two sets must be equal.

##### Lemma 3.14.1
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is a boundary point of $S$, and is not contained in $S$, then $x$ is an accumulation point.

By the definition of a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain at least one element of $S$. Because $x \notin S$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain the element of $S$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.
##### Theorem 3.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is a closed set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq S$. In other words, a set $S$ is closed if and only if all boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

Suppose $S$ is closed. We must show that all of its boundary points are elements of $S$. Let $x \in \partial(S)$. 
Suppose $x \notin S$, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 3 14 1|#Lemma 3 14 1]] it would be an accumulation point of $S$. Because $S$ is closed this implies that $x \in S$. This is a contradiction, meaning our assumption must be false and $x$ must be in $S$.

Now suppose all of the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$. We must show that $S$ is closed. Let us do this through contradiction.
Assume that all the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$, but $S$ is not closed. By the definition of $S$ not being closed, there must be a $x \in S'|x\notin S$. This means that for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain an element of $S$. $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ contains an element of $S$. Because it contains $x$ as well, it contains an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well, thus satisfying the definition of a boundary point. This means that $x$ is a boundary point of $S$ not within $S$, contradicting our initial assumption and completing the proof.

##### Corollary 3.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

First we must show the forward direction: If $S\in R$ is an open set, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

If $S$ is open, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $\partial(S)\subseteq(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. Therefore $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. Therefore by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

Now we must show the backward direction: If $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set, then $S$ is an open set.

By definition [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ being closed we know that $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But this implies that $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. So by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $S$ is open.

Q.E.D.

##### Theorem 3.17
> [!none]
> - [x]  The intersection of finitely many open sets is open

Consider $S=\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}S_{i}$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $S_{i}$ is open. Now consider the set $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$. Because $S_{i}$ is open [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]] guarantees $\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$ must be closed. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must then be closed because it is a union of a finite number of closed intervals ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]]). Then again by Corollary 3.16 $S$ must be open if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

##### Theorem 3.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of any collection of open sets is open.

Let $X$ be any collection of open sets. Let our set $S=\bigcup\limits_{O\in S}O$ where every $O \in S$ is open. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcap\limits_{O\in S}\mathbb{R}\setminus O$. Because every $O \in S$ is open, $\mathbb{R}\setminus O$ must be closed by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]]. This means that $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is the intersection of a collection of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must be closed. Because $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed, $S$ must be open by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]].

##### Example 3.19
> [!none] 
> $F=\{ (1,4),(1,2),(3,7) \}$ is a collection of three open sets. Notice that the interval $(1,2)$ is an element of $F$ (not a subset of $F$) so we can write $(1,2)\in F$. At the same time we have that $\{ (1,2) \}\subseteq  F$.

$0 \in [0,1]$ is not in any interval of the form $(0,i)$ where $i \in I=\mathbb{N}$. Thus it is not "covered" by $F$.

##### Exercise 3.23

Consider the open set $(0,1)$. If we set $O_{1}=\left( 0, \frac{3}{4} \right)$, and $O_{2}=\left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)$. Note that both sets are subsets of $(0,1)$. Let $I=\{ 1,2 \}$. Let $F=\{ O_{i}|i \in I \}$. $\bigcup\limits_{O \in F}O=(0,1)$ and thus $F$ is an open cover comprised of only subsets of $(0,1)$.

We must now show that $1$ *is* a boundary point for $\mathbb{N}$. If we consider any $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ will contain an element of $\mathbb{N}$ (namely, $1$). If we consider the deleted neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(1)=(1-\varepsilon,1+\varepsilon)$, it is an interval, so it must contain an infinite amount of points. But in between any two real numbers ($1-\varepsilon$ and $1+\varepsilon$) there can only be a finite number of natural numbers. Thus there must be elements in the interval which are not in $\mathbb{N}$ and for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ contains an element of the natural numbers, and element not in the natural numbers, satisfying the definition of a boundary point.

Obviously $1\in \mathbb{N}$, so we have show that $1 \in \mathbb{N}\setminus \partial(\mathbb{N})$ and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}\setminus  \mathbb{N}'$. Thus the two sets are not equal and the statement has been disproven.

##### Exercise 3.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ closed and $T$ is open, then $S\cap T$ is not open.

This is false. Consider $S=[0,10]$ and $T=(2,6)$. $S\cap T=(2,6)$, which is open.

##### Exercise 3.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $T\setminus S$ is open.

We will disprove this statement. Let $T=[0,10]$ and $S=(4,6)$. $T\setminus S=[0,4]\cup [6,10]$, which is a closed set.

##### Exercise 3.29*
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $S\setminus T$ is open.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] if we can show for all elements $x \in \partial(S\setminus T)$, $x\notin S\setminus T$, then $S\setminus T$ must be open. $x \notin S\setminus T$ is equivalent to $x \in T \lor x \notin S$.

Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\partial(S\setminus T)$. We must show that $x \in T$, or $x$ is not in $S$ in order to prove that $S\setminus T$ is open. 

By the definition of a boundary point for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $y \in N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ such that $y \in R\setminus(S\setminus T)\Leftrightarrow y \in T \lor y \notin S$.

In the case where $y \notin S$, it is impossible for $x$ to be an interior point. Because $S$ is open, that means that $x \notin S$.
In the case where $y \in T$, we have that $x$ is an accumulation point. Because $T$ is closed, this implies $x \in T$.

Both of these outcomes are sufficient to guarantee that $S\setminus T$ is open.

##### Theorem 3.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $cl(S)=S \cup \partial(S)$.

First we will show that $cl(S)=S\cup S'\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$. Let $x$ be an element of $S\cup S'$. If $x \in S$ then it is clearly also in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Consider the case where $x \notin S$ and $x \in S'$. If we consider neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, it must include an element not in $S$ (namely, $x$), and because it is an accumulation point it must also contain an element *in* $S$. By definition this makes it an accumulation point. Thus every element of $S\cup S'$ is an element of $S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S\cup S'\subseteq S \cup \partial(S)$.

Now we must show that $S\cup \partial(S)\subseteq S\cup S'$. Consider a $y$ in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Again, if $y$ is in $S$ it obviously must be in $S\cup S'$. Consider the case where it is not and $y \in \partial(S)$ and $y \notin S$. Because $y$ is a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$. $y$ is not in $S$, so $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. By definition this makes $y \in S'$ and thus $y \in S\cup S'$.

Thus we have show that $cl(S)\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S \cup \partial(S) \subseteq cl(S)$, so they must be equal.

##### Exercise 3.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=(0,1)$ and let $F=\left\{  \left( 0,1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)|n \in \mathbb{N}  \right\}$. Is $F$ an open cover for $S$? Show that there is no finite subset of $F$ which also covers $S$.

We will prove that $F$ is indeed an open cover for $(0,1)$. 

If we consider any number $x \in (0,1)$, there will always exist an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}<1-x$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]]. Therefore $x<1-\frac{1}{n}$. We also know that $x>0$ (because $x \in (0,1)$), so $x \in \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By construction this means that $x$ is in one of the elements of $S$, and thus must be in the union of all of the elements of $F$. Because $x$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, this implies that $F$ is an open cover for $(0,1)$.

For any finite subset of $F$ which we will call $F'$, consider the set $S=\left\{  n \in \mathbb{N}|\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)\in F'  \right\}$. Because this set is finite we can select a maximal element which we will call $b$. Notice that for every $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$ if $x<y$ then $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{x} \right)\subseteq\left( 0,1-\frac{1}{y} \right)$. We selected $b$ as a maximal element of $S$, so for every interval in $F'$, it must be a subset of $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{b} \right)$. Thus if there is a number which is not in $\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$ it will not be in any element of $F'$.

Now consider the endpoint of that interval $1-\frac{1}{b}$. Because it is an open interval $1-\frac{1}{b}\notin \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$. $b$ is a natural number, so $\frac{1}{b}$ is less than one (in the case where $b=1$ the set would be empty), and greater than zero. Thus $0<1- \frac{1}{b}<1$, and $1- \frac{1}{b} \in (0,1)$. We have produced a number which is in $(0,1)$, but is not "covered" by $F$.

#### 4.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 4.1
> [!none] 
> A function $a:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ is called a sequence. When discussing a sequence, we will typically denote individual elements of the range using subscripts: $a_{i}:=a(1),a_{2}:=a(2)$, etc. We will then denote the entire sequence by $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$, or $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots)$, or simple just by $a_{n}$.

##### Example 4.2
> [!none] 
> The sequence $(n^{2})_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,4,9,16,\dots)$ is the sequence of each of the natural numbers squared. It is clear that the further we go in the sequence, the larger the sequence elements become.

##### Example 4.3
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \sin\left( \frac{\pi n}{2} \right) \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0)$ is a sequence that taeks on the values of $1,0,$ and $-1$ in a repeating pattern. It is clear that the pattern displayed in this sequence will continue forever.

##### Example 4.4
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \frac{n+5}{n} \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has its first few terms as 5,3,7/3,2,9/5,5/3,... It appears that the terms in this sequence are getting smaller; but it is unclear at first glance whether this trend continues. If we look out a bit into the sequence, we see that $a_{100}=\frac{105}{100}=1.05$, and if go really far we see that $a_{8745}\approx 1.00057$. So it seems like the "long-term" behavior of this sequence is to have sequence elements that "get close to" the number 1.

##### Definition 4.5
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to **converge to a number** $L$ if and only if $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$ then $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. In this case, we say that the $(a_{n})$ is a **convergent sequence** and that the number $L$ is a **limit** of the sequence ($a_{n}$).

##### Definition 4.6
> [!none] 
> A sequence ($a_{n}$) is said to **eventually** have a property $P$ if and only if there exists an $N$ such that, whenever $n>N$, $a_{n}$ has property $P$. In other words: ($a_{n}$) eventually has property $P$ if there exists an $N$ such that every term with index greater than $N$ has property $P$.

##### Exercise 4.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }$. Show that $a_{n}$ will eventually be greater than or equal to $10$. 

We will do this through proof by induction.

Base case: $a_{100}=10$.

Inductive hypothesis: $\sqrt{ n+x }$ is always greater than $\sqrt{ n }$ if $x>0$. Thus if if any $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }\geq10$, then $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{ n+1 }$ must be as well. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\geq100$, $a_{n}\leq10$ .

##### Theorem 4.8 (Uniqueness of Limits)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L$, and also converges to a number $M$. Then $L=M$.

$L=M$ if and only if $\left| L-M \right|<0$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. Suppose we choose an $N$ such that if $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $\left| a_{n}-M \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. By the triangle inequality
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-L-(a_{n}-M) \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\left| M-L \right| <\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus $M$ must equal $L$.

##### Example 4.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$.
> 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\frac{1}{n}$ can be smaller than any real number. Consider $\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|=\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ we can produce an $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than it, so the limit must be 0.

##### Example 4.10
> [!none] 
> Use the definition of limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{2n+1}{3n+4}= \frac{2}{3}$.

This proof is not that hard, but very lengthy, so just refer to the books if you need to.

##### Exercise 4.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}=1$.

$\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}= \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 9|#Example 4 9]] we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{n}=0$, so our limit must equal 1.

##### Exercise 4.12
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Use the definition of limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{4n-5}{n+2}=4$.

This is essentially identical to [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 10|#Example 4 10]]. 
##### Exercise 4.13
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. What does it mean for a number $L$ to not a a limit of $a_{n}$?

If $L$ is a limit of $a_{n}$ that means
$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists N \in\mathbb{N}|\forall n>N (\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon)
$

For $L$ to not be a limit of $a_{n}$ we negate the definition to get
$
\exists\varepsilon>0|\forall N \in\mathbb{N},\exists n>N|(\left| a_{n}-L \right| \geq\varepsilon )
$

In words: There exists an $\varepsilon$ greater than zero such that for all $N$ in the natural numbers there will exists an $n$ greater than $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is not within a distance $\varepsilon$ of $L$.

##### Exercise 4.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,\dots)$ does not converge to the number 1.

Consider an $\varepsilon=0.5$. For any $N$ there will always be an $n$ such that $a_{n}=-1$ and $\left| a_{n}-1 \right|=2\geq0.5$. Thus the definition for not being a limit point as given in the previous exercise has been fulfilled and $1$ is not a limit of the sequence.

#### 4.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 4.15 (First Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B \text{ and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}-b_{n})=A-B.
> \end{align}
> $

$(i)$
Let $\varepsilon>0$.
By definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall n>N_{1},\left| a_{n}-A \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall n>N_{2},\left| b_{n}-B \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\end{align}
$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$. For all $n>N$
$
\begin{align}
&\left| a_{n}+b_{n}-(A+B) \right|= \left| (a_{n}-A)+(b_{n}-B) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-A \right|+\left| b_{n}-B \right|  < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
The triangle allows the first line to be less than or equal to the second line.
By definition this means that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B$.

$(ii)$
Consider the sequence $-b_{n}$. We will show that its limit is $-B$. $\left| -b_{n}-(-B) \right|=\left| B-b_{n} \right|$ which we can make arbitrarily small cause $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$. Then we just use the previous result and add $a_{n}+(-b_{n})$, and their limits will add, meaning $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}-b_{n}=A-B)$

##### Theorem 4.16 (Second Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}\cdot b_{n})=A\cdot B \\
> &\text{ Also, if $B\neq0$, then $b_{n}\neq0$ for sufficiently large n and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \left( \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} \right)=\frac{A}{B}
> \end{align}
> $

$(i)$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}b_{n}-AB \right|&=\left| a_{n}b_{n}-Ab_{n}+Ab_{n}-AB \right|  \\
&= \left| b_{n}(a_{n}-A) +A(b_{n}-B)\right| \\
&\leq \left| b_{n} \right| \left| a_{n} -A\right|+\left| A \right| \left| b_{n}-B \right|   
\end{align}
$

By definition of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ we can make $\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ and $\left| b_{n}-B \right|$ as small as we would like. Thus the only thing we need to show in order to make the expression less than $\varepsilon$ is to show that $b_{n}$ will be bounded, so we can make $\left| b_{n} \right|\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ as small as we would like. A much more fleshed out argument is given in the book.

$(ii)$
The crux of this proof is in the fact that
$
\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right| =\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{B\cdot b_{n}} \right| 
$
and we can make $B-b_{n}$ as small as we want, and $B\cdot b_{n}$ is bounded. Thus $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$, and then we can just think of this as the multiplication of two series.
##### Theorem 4.17 (Order Limit Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence that converges to a limit $A$. If $a_{n}\geq0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq0$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose that $A<0$. By definition of a limit we can produce an $a_{n}$ such that $\left| a_{n}-A \right|<\left| A \right|$. Because $a_{n}>A$ and $A<0$ this is equivalent to $a_{n}-A<-A$. But this would imply that $a_{n}$ is negative, giving us our contradiction.

##### Corollary 4.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ and $(b_{n})$ be sequences that converge to limits $A$ and $B$, respectfully. If $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq B$.

Consider the sequence $c_{n}=a_{n}-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B$. Because $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $a_{n}-b_{n}\leq0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B\geq0\to A\geq B$. 

##### Definition 4.19
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **bounded** if and only if $\exists B>0$ such that $\left| a_{n} \right|<B$, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, a sequence is bounded if there exists two number $B_{1},B_{2}$ such that $B_{1}<a_{n}<B_{2}$ for every sequence element $a_{n}$.

##### Definition 4.20
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **increasing** (resp. strictly increasing) if and only if $a_{n+1}>a_{n}$ ($a_{n+1}>a_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Similarly, a sequence $(b_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **decreasing** (strictly decreasing) if and only if $b_{n+1}\leq b_{n}$ ($b_{n+1}<b_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. A sequence is said to be **monotone** if and only if the sequence is increasing or is decreasing.

##### Theorem 4.21 (Monotone Convergence Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Every bounded monotone sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ converges.

We will prove that every bounded increasing sequence will converge, but the proof that every bounded decreasing sequence will converge is structured exactly the same.

Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ is bounded and increasing. Let $S=\{ a_{n}|n \in \mathbb{N} \}$, and $m=\text{ sup}(S)$ (we know that $\text{ sup}(S)$ exists because $S$ is bounded). We will use $m$ as a candidate limit for $a_{n}$. Let $\varepsilon>0$. There must exists an $x \in S$ such that $m-\varepsilon<x<m$, by the definition of a supremum. Because $x \in S$ that means $\exists l \in N|a_{l}=x$ and $m-\varepsilon<a_{l}<\varepsilon$. $a_{n}$ is increasing, so for every $n>l$, $m>a_{n}>a_{l}>m-\varepsilon$ ($a_{n}$ must be $<m$ because $m$ is the supremum). Therefore every element after $a_{l} \in N_{\varepsilon}(m)$, and thus $m$ must be the limit of the sequence.

#### 4.3 Follow Up Work

##### Exercise 4.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Develop complete proofs of all lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Lemma 4.23
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $b_{n}$ converges to a number $B\neq 0$. Then there exists a constant $\alpha>0$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ sufficiently large. (Here, we say that $b_{n}$ is eventually bounded away from zero.)

First we will show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N$, $b_{n}\in N_{B}(B)$. Let $n>N$.

If $B\geq0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{+}$ so every $b_{n}$ must be positive. If this is the case then $\left| b_{n} \right|=b_{n}$ and clearly the two must have the same limit $\left| B \right|=B$.
If $B<0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{-}$ and every $b_{n}$ must be negative. Thus $\left| b_{n} \right|=-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }-b_{n}=-B=\left| B \right|$. Thus is both cases $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$.

Using this fact let we know that $0<\left| B \right|=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|$. Let $\alpha$ be a real number such that $0<\alpha<\left| B \right|$. We can now produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N, \left| b_{n} \right|\in N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(\left| B \right|)$. Every element in $N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(B)$ is greater than $\alpha$, so we $N$ is the number we were seeking to produce and we are done.

##### Exercise 4.24*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove part $(ii)$ of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]]

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed number.

Because $B\neq0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 23|#Lemma 4 23]] there exists an $\alpha$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ greater than some $N_{1}\in\mathbb{N}$. It then follows that $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}} \right|< \frac{1}{\alpha}$.
Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there exists an $N_{2}$ such that $\forall n >N_{2}$
$
\left| b_{n}-B \right|<\left| B\alpha \right|\cdot \varepsilon  
$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$ and suppose that $n>N$.
$
\begin{align}
&\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}  -\frac{1}{B} \right|=\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{Bb_{n}} \right| =\left| \frac{1}{Bb_{n}} \right|\left| B-b_{n} \right|    \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha} \right| \left| B-b_{n} \right|  \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha } \right| \left| B\alpha \cdot \varepsilon  \right| =\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
Therefore for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists an $N$ such that $\forall n >N$, $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right|<\varepsilon$ and thus by definition $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$. We know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$, so using part $(i)$. of the Second Algebraic Limit Theorem we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\cdot \frac{1}{b_{n}}=A/B$.

##### Theorem 4.25 (The Squeeze Theorem for Sequences)*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$, and $c_{n}$ are three sequences, and suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}$. If $a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}$ for all $n$ sufficiently large, then $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L.$

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

By the definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall  n >N_{1},\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall  n >N_{2},\left| b_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\end{align}
$
Let $n>max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$
$
\begin{align}
\left| L-a_{n} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
L-a_{n}&<\varepsilon \\
a_{n}&>L-\varepsilon \\
\left| b_{n}-L \right| &<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}-L&<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}&<\varepsilon+L
\end{align}
$
Therefore
$
\displaylines{
L-\varepsilon<a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}<\varepsilon+L\\
-\varepsilon<c_{n}-L<\varepsilon
}
$
Thus $\left| c_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$, and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L$.

##### Exercise 4.26
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Show that if $a_{n}$ converges to a limit $L$, then $a_{n}$ is bounded.

Choose a specific $\varepsilon>0$. By the definition of a limit $\exists N$ such that $\forall n>N, a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Thus every term after $a_{N}$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon+L$ and bounded below by $L-\varepsilon$. If we look at the sequence $a_{1-(N-1)}$, it is finite, so it must have an upper bound $M_{1}$ and a lower bound $B_{1}$. If we let $M=max\{ M_{1},\varepsilon+L \}$ and $B=\{ B_{1},L-\varepsilon \}$ then $M$ and $B$ will bound the whole sequence.

##### Defintion 4.27
> [!none] 
> We say that a sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is **in a set** $S$ if and only if $a_{n} \in S$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

##### Lemma 4.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ is a sequence in $S$, and suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L.$ Then $L \in S\cup S'$.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. 

Case 1: $L \in S$. We are done.

Case 2: $L\notin S$. We must show that $L \in S'$.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By the definition of a limit, $\exists N$ such that for all $n>N$ $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Suppose that every sequence element $a_{n}=L$. This would mean that the limit $L$ would equal $a_{n}$, which is an element of $S$, giving a contradiction. So there must be at least one $a_{i}$ where $i\geq n$ and $a_{i} \neq L$. Thus $a_{i}\in N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(L)$ and we have satisfied the definition of an accumulation point for $L$.

##### Lemma 4.29*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ be a set. If $x \in S'$, then there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ that satisfies $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

By the definition of an accumulation point $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ is nonempty for all $\varepsilon>0$. Notice that this set is equivalent to $N_{\varepsilon}(x)\cap S\setminus \{ x \}$. Thus for any epsilon we can produce a $y \in S\setminus \{ x \}$ in that epsilon neighborhood. Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists y_{1}|y_{1} \in N_{1}(x) \\
&\exists y_{2}|y_{2} \in N_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) \\
&\exists y_{3}|y_{3} \in N_{\frac{1}{3}}(x) \\
&\vdots\\
&\exists y_{n}|y_{n} \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x) \\
\end{align}
$
Where every $y_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (Notice that every $y_{n}$ does not have to be distinct; the function will just not be 1-1).

Now consider the sequence $a_{n}=y_{n}$. Because every $y_{n} \in S\setminus \{ x \}$, $a_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$. We now have to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. 

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|Theorem 1.3]] we can produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<\varepsilon$. Consider any $a_{m}$ such that $m>N$. $a_{m} \in N_{\frac{1}{m}}(x)\subseteq N_{\frac{1}{N}}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}$. Thus for every $m>N$ $\left| a_{m}-x \right|<\varepsilon$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

##### Corollary 4.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $p \in cl(T)$ if and only if there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $T$ such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} = p$.

First we will show the forward direction: If $p \in cl(T)$ then there exists a sequence such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$. [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] guarantees that if $p \in S'$ then we can produce such a sequence. Thus we only have to consider the case where $p \in S$, which is trivial because obviously the sequence $a_{n}=p,\forall n \in N$ converges to $p$.

[[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] Proves the backward direction.

##### Theorem 4.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

Forward direction: If $S$ is closed, then every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] if $a_{n}$ converges, it must converge to an element in $S\cup S'=cl(S)$, but because $S$ is closed $cl(S)=S$, and thus $a_{n}$ must converge to an element in $S$.

Backward direction: If every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\in S$, then $S$ is closed.

Let $x \in S'$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (and thus also in $S$), such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. By our assumption this means that $x \in S$. Thus we have proved that $S'\subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed.

##### Definition 4.32
> [!none] 
> A sequence $b_{n}$ is said to **diverge to** infinity (denoted $\lim\limits_{ b_{n} \to \infty }=\infty$) if and only if $\forall P>0,\exists M>0$ such that if $n\geq M$ then $b_{n}>P$. Similarly, a sequence $c_{n}$ is said to diverge to negative infinity if and only if $\forall P<0,\exists M>0$ such that if $n\geq M$, then $c_{n}<P$.

##### Exercise 4.33
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(\sqrt{ n })$ diverges to $\infty$.

Let $P>0$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there exists an $N$ such that $N>P^{2}\to \sqrt{ N }>P$. Thus for all $n\geq N$, $\sqrt{ n }>P$, and $\sqrt{ n }$ diverges to $\infty$.

##### Exercise 4.34*
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Suppose $a_{n}$ is a sequence of positive numbers that converges to a number $L$. Then, for any positive integer $m$, the sequence of roots $(\sqrt[m]{ a_{n} })_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\sqrt[m]{ L }$.

##### Exercise 4.35
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Suppose that $a_{1}=1$ and that $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{ 20+a_{n} }$. Show that $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges, and find its limit.

##### Exercise 4.36
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  This exercise is really long and I don't want to write it out. Look at it in the book.

##### Exercise 4.37
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Let $a_{n}(x):=\cos(nx)$. (We can interpret this so that for each fixed $x$, the sequence $a_{n}(x)$ is a sequence.) Clearly, $(a_{n}(0))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges and $(a_{n}(2\pi))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges. Prove that the sequence $(a_{n}(x))$ diverges if $x \in (0,2\pi)$.

The books skeleton is pretty much the entire proof. Refer there.

##### Exercise 4.38
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Again, this is too long to write out. Refer to the textbook.

### Chapter 5

#### 5.1 Preliminary Work

##### Defintion 5.1
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **Cauchy** if and only if for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $M>0$ such that $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ for all integers $n,m\geq M$.

##### Exercise 5.2
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$ is a Cauchy sequence.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we can produce an $M>0$ such that for all $n>M$ $\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|<\varepsilon$. Let $m>M$ as well. Because $\frac{1}{m}$ is positive and less than $\frac{1}{n}$, $\left| \frac{1}{n} -\frac{1}{m}\right|<\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|<\varepsilon$. Thus $\frac{1}{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L \in \mathbb{R}$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

Let $M$ be a number such that for $\forall n>M$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, and suppose that $n$ and $m$ are both greater than $M$.

$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| &=\left| (a_{n}-L)+(L-a_{m}) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-L \right| +\left| L-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus for any $n,m>M$, $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ and so $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If a sequence is Cauchy, then it is bounded

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

There exists an $M>0$ such that for all $n,m>M$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon  
\end{align}
$
Let $n$ be fixed and set $a_{n}=A$.
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{m}-A \right| &<\varepsilon  \\
a_{m}-A&<\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&<\varepsilon+A \\
\left| A-a_{m} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
A-a_{m}&<\varepsilon \\ 
a_{m}-A&>-\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&>A-\varepsilon
\end{align}
$

Thus $A-\varepsilon$ is a lower bound and $A+\varepsilon$ is an upper bound for every element after $a_{M}$. The sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{M}$ is finite and thus must be bounded above by some number $B$ and bounded below by $-B$. Thus $min\{ A-\varepsilon,-B \}$ must be a lower bound for the whole sequence, and $max\{ A+\varepsilon,B \}$ must be an upper bound for the whole sequence.

##### Definition 5.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is called a **subsequence** of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$. If a subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L_{1}$ then we say that $L_{1}$ is a **subsequential limit** of the original sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$.

##### Exercise 5.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})=\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$. Explain why $\left( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots \right)$ is a subsequence of $(a_{n})$, but $\left( 1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{4},\dots \right)$ is not.

In the first case the subsequence is strictly increasing (the denominators are always going up), while in the second case it is not.

##### Exercise 5.8
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence, where $a_{n}$ is defined to be $\frac{1}{n}$ if $n$ is even, and $\frac{n}{n+4}$ if $n$ is odd.
> 1. Write out the first eight terms of this sequence.
> 2. Let $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2k)_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2,4,8,\dots)$. Write out the first few terms of the subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})$. What is your conjecture for the value of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{m_{k}}$?
> 3. Let $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2k-1)_{k=1}^{\infty}=(1,3,5,7,\dots)$. Write out the first few terms of the subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})$. What is your conjecture for the value of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{m_{k}}$?

1. $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{8}= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{7}{11}, \frac{1}{8}$
2. $(a_{2k})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{6},\dots$ This seems like it will approach 0.
3. $(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{7}{11},\dots$ This seems to be approaching $\frac{1}{2}$.

##### Lemma 5.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $m_{k}\geq k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by induction.

Base case: $k=1$. if $m_{k}$ is in the natural numbers then it must be $\geq1=k$. Thus the base case is verified.

Induction hypothesis: Assume that for some natural number $k$, $m_{k}\geq k$. We must then show that $m_{k+1}\geq k+1$. This is very straightforward to verify because $m_{k}$ is strictly increasing.

#### 5.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 5.10
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ and $l \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$ if and only if all subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$.

Forward direction: If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$, then all of the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ as well.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value. There must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$. Every $a_{m_{k}}$ where $m_{k}>N$ must be within this epsilon range as well, making it convergent.

Backward direction: If all the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must as well.
This proof is trivial, because $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a subsequence of itself.

##### Theorem 5.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence and let $b_{k}:=a_{2k}$ and $c_{k}:=a_{2k+1}$. Show that $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L$ if and only if both $(b_{k})$ and $(c_{k})$ converges to $L$.

This is just applying the theorem above?

##### Lemma 5.12 (Monotone Subsequence Lemma)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a monotone subsequence.

Let $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. We will call a term $a_{M}$ a **dominant term** if and only if $a_{M}>a_{n}$ for all $n>M$.

There must either be a finite amount of dominant terms for $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or an or an infinite amount.

If there is an infinite number of dominant terms, then the subsequence $\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ of dominant terms will be decreasing by definition of a dominant term.

If there is a finite amount of dominant terms there must exists a greatest dominant term (greatest not in value, but in its placement in the sequence), $a_{N}$. Thus for all $n>N$, $a_{n}$ cannot be a dominant term. By negating the definition of a dominant term, we get the following fact:

> [!none] 
> For every $n>N$  there must exists an $m>n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_{m}\geq a_{n}$.

Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists m_{1}>N+1:a_{m_{1}}\geq a_{N+1}\\
&\exists m_{2}>m_{1}:a_{m_{2}}\geq a_{m_{1}}\\
&\exists m_{3}>m_{1}:a_{m_{3}}\geq a_{m_{2}}\\
&\vdots\\
&\exists m_{k}>m_{k-1}:a_{m_{k}}\geq a_{m_{k-1}}\\
\end{align}
$
Thus if we set $\{ a_{n_{k}} \}=\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ by construction the sequence will be increasing and thus monotone.

In both the case where there are a finite number of dominant terms, and in the case where there is an infinite number, we can produce a monotone sequence.

##### Theorem 5.13 (Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence.

Combining the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem|#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem]] with [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma|#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma]] gives us the desired result.

##### Lemma 5.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})$ has a convergent subsequence, then $a_{n}$ must converge.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value and $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a convergent subsequence within $(a_{n})$.
$
\exists N_{1}|\forall k>N_{1}  \left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$
$
\exists N_{2}\forall n,m>N\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$

Let $k>N_{1}$ and $n,m>N_{2}$.
$
\left| a_{n}-L \right| \leq \left| a_{n}-a_{m_{k}} \right| +\left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon.
$

##### Theorem 5.15 (Cauchy Criterion)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

1. Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. (Easy to prove the same way we did for convergent sequences in [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 4 26|#Exercise 4 26]]).
2. Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences]])
3. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence.
4. Every Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges ([[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 14|#Lemma 5 14]]).
5. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

### Chapter 1

#### 1.1 Preliminary Work
##### Axiom 1.1
> [!none] 
> $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[Ordered field|Ordered field]].

##### Axiom 1.2 (The Archimedean Principle)
> [!none] 
> For every number $b\in \mathbb{R}$, there is some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ that is larger than $b$.

##### Theorem 1.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  For any positive number $\epsilon$, there exists a number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than $\epsilon$.

Pick a $\delta>0$ such that $\frac{1}{\delta}=\epsilon$. The AP gives that for some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$
$
\begin{align}
n&>\delta \\
\frac{1}{n}&< \frac{1}{\delta} = \epsilon
\end{align}
$

##### Axiom 1.4 (The Well Ordering Principle for $\mathbb{N}$)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ as a least element

##### Theorem 1.5 (The Principle of Mathematical Induction)
> [!none] 
> - [x] 
> Consider a statement $P(N)$ that is defined for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that 
> 1. $P(1)$ is true, and
> 2. for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, if $P(n)$ is true then $P(n+1)$ is true.
> 
> Then $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose the hypotheses are true, but the conclusion is false.

Consider the set $S:=\{ n\in\mathbb{N}|P(n) \text{ is false} \}$. By our initial assumption this set cannot be empty. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well-Ordering Principle for mathbb N|Well-Ordering Principle]] this set has a least element $l$. $P(l-1)$ must be true, otherwise $l-1$ would be in the set, and $l$ would not be the least element. But if $l-1$ is true, then by our first assumption, $P(l-1+1)=P(l)$ must be true. Therefore $P(l)$ is must true, and false (because it is in $S$), giving us our contradiction.

##### Definition 1.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are nonempty sets. Then $A$ is said to be **equinumerous** with $B$ iff there exists a bijection $f:A\to B$. In this case we write $A \sim B$ and say that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality.

##### Definition 1.7
> [!none]
> A set $S$ is said to be **finite** if and only if $S=\emptyset$ or $S \sim \{ 1,\dots ,n\}$, we say that $S$ is **finite with** $n$ **elements** and write $\left| S \right|=n$, where $\left| S \right|$ is referred to as the number of elements in the finite set $S$.

##### Exercise 1.8
> [!none] 
> - [x] Explicity show that the set $\{ North, East, South, West \}$ and the set $\{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ are equinumerous in the sense of [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 7|Definition 1.7]] (i.e., by constructing a bijection between the two sets). Do these sets satisfy definition 1.7 for some $n$?

Consider the function $f:\{ North, East, South, West \} \to \{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ s.t.
$
\begin{align}
f(North) &= 1 \\
f(East) &= 4 \\
f(South) &= 7 \\
f(West) &= 10
\end{align}
$
It is trivial to show that $f$ is a 1-1 and onto, and that both sets are equinumerous to the set $\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$.

##### Definition 1.9
> [!none] 
> Let $S$ be a set. Then the **power set of** $S$, denoted $P(S)$ is the set that contains all subsets of $S$.

##### Example 1.10
> [!none] 
> Consider the set $S=\{ 1,2 \}$ with two elements in it. Its power set, $P(S)=\{ \emptyset,\{ 1 \},\{ 2 \},\{ 1,2 \} \}$, is a set with four elements in it

##### Theorem 1.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let  $S$ be a set with $n$ elements in it. Then $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements in it.

If $S$ has one element in it $P(S)=S$, both of which have 1 element in them. When you add an element to any set, the new power set will be the old power set, plus every set in the old power set plus the new element. Thus every time we add a new element we double the elements in the power set. It is easy to show that these two facts, when combined, imply that $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements when $S$ has $n$ elements.

Alternatively, to construct any set we could iterate through every element of the set and either put it in the set, or not. This results in $2^{n}$ different ways we could construct the sets.

##### Definition 1.12
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **countably infinite** (or **denumerable**) if and only if $S \sim \mathbb{N}$. A set $S$ is said to be **countable** if and only if $S$ is finite or countably infinite.

##### Exercise 1.13
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Show that $2\mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{N}$ by identifying a bijection between them.

Consider the function $f:2\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(e) = \frac{e}{2}
\end{align}
$
for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ $f(2n)$ will map to $n$, ensuring that the function is onto. If $f(m)=f(n)$ then $2n=2m$, which implies $n=m$, showing that the function is also 1-1, and thus a bijection.

##### Theorem 1.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The sets $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality (or, put another way: $\mathbb{Z}$ is countably infinite).

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(n)&=\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)\qquad n \text{ is even} \\
f(n)&=-\frac{n-1}{2}\qquad n \text{ is odd}
\end{align}
$
For any positive integer $x$, $f(2x)$ will map to it ($2x$ is guaranteed to be a natural number). For any negative (or = 0) integer $y$, $f(-2y +1)$ will map to $y$. Therefore $f$ is onto.

Suppose $f(m)=f(n)$. WLG, if $m$ is odd, and $n$ is even, then we have:
$
\begin{align}
\frac{n}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
n&= -m+1 \\
n+m&= 1
\end{align}
$
But if both $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers their sum must be greater than $1$. Therefore one cannot be even and the other odd.

It's trivial to show the following equations are only true when $n=m$.
$
\begin{align}
-\frac{n-1}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
\frac{n}{2}&=\frac{m}{2}
\end{align}
$
Thus $f$ is 1-1 as well, making it a bijection.

#### 1.2 Main Theorems

##### Composition of Two Bijections Lemma
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ are bijections, then the composite function $f \circ g:A\to C$ will be a bijection as well.

This is a fact will be useful in multiple of the following proofs.

First we will prove that for bijections $f:X\to S$ and $g:S\to V$, $g\circ f:X \to V$ is a bijection as well. 

For every element $v\in V$ there exists an element in $x \in X$ such that maps to it (by the definition of $f$ being onto). For every $x$ there is an element $s \in S$ which maps to it, because $g$ is onto. Thus there exists an $s \in S$ that will map to any $v \in V$, so $g \circ f$ in onto.

Next, we must show that $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well.

If $g(f(n))=g(f(m))$ then because $g$ is 1-1, $f(n)=f(m)$. Because $f$ is 1-1 as well that implies $n=m$, so $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well as onto.



##### Theorem 1.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable

If $S\in\mathbb{N}$ is finite, then it is countable by definition.

The meat of the proof lies in proving that $S$ is countable when it is infinite. 

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to S$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(1) &= min(S) \\
f(2) &= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1) \}) \\
\vdots \\
f(n)&=min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(n-1) \})
\end{align}
$

We know that such minimum elements must exist because of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|well ordering principle]]. Our job is now to show that this function is both 1-1 and onto.

Consider the the following set where $x \in S$
$
S_{x}:=\{ y \in S|y\leq x \} 
$

Because this set is bounded below (Well Ordering Principle), and above (by x), it is finite, and thus has a cardinality.

For any $x \in S$ consider $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)$. The cardinality of $S_{x}$ is 1+ the number of elements less than $x$ in $S$ (the +1 is because $x$ is included in the set as well). Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|) = min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots f(\left| S_{x}-1 \right|) \})$ take the least element of the set $S$ with all the elements less than $x$ removed. Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)=x$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $x \in S$, $f$ is onto.

We will argue that $f$ is 1-1 by contradiction. If $f$ were not 1-1, then there exists an $n$ and $m$ such that $f(n)=f(m)$ and $n\neq m$. That implies that WLOG, $n<m$. $f(m)= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \})$. Because $n<m$ $f(n)$ must not be in the set $S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \}$. $f(m)$ must in in this set, because it is the least element of it. But $f(m)=f(n)$, so $f(n)$ is in this set. Thus we have our contradiction, showing that $f$ is 1-1.

Therefore, $f$ is 1-1 and onto, making it a bijection, and making the set $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every subset of a countable set is countable.

Suppose $X\subseteq S$ where $S$ is a countable set.
If a set $S$ is countable, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $\mathbb{N}\to S$. Consider the sets $\mathbb{N}':=\{ n \in \mathbb{N}|f(n) \in X \}$. If we use the same function $f$, but change the domain and codomain such that it goes from $\mathbb{N}'\to S$, it is not difficult to see that it is a bijection.

By construction the function is onto, and we already know that it is 1-1. Therefore there $f$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}'$ to $X$. But $\mathbb{N}'$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|Theorem 1.15]] $X$ must be countable as well.

##### Theorem 1.17
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $F$ is a collection of nonempty sets, then the equinumerous relation $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation on $F$.

To show that $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation we must show that it is reflexive ($A\sim A$), symmetric (if$A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$), and transitive (if $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$).

1. Reflexive—If we consider the function $f:A\to A$ for all $a\in A$ such that $f(a)= a$, checking that it is onto and 1-1 is trivial.
2. Symmetry—If $A\sim B$ then there exists a bijection $f$ from $A\to B$ for all $a\in A$, and $b\in B$. The inverse of a bijection is still a bijection, it is easy to verify that $f^{-1}$ is a bijection from $B\to A$. Thus implying that $B\sim A$.
3. Transitive—If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$ then there exists bijections $f$ and $g$ from $A\to B$ and from $B\to C$ respectively. Once again, it is straightforward to verify that the function $f \circ g$ is a bijection from $A \to C$, implying that $A \sim C$.

##### Theorem 1.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. If there exists an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:\mathbb{N} \to T$, then $T$ is countable.

Thus we have a bijection from $S$ to $f(S)$, which is a subset of of $N$. Thus 
First, we will consider the case where there is an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$. $f$ is already 1-1, and if we change the codomain to $f(S)$, then by definition it is onto as well. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|#Theorem 1 15]] because $f(S) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, $f(S)$ is countable. If $f(S)$ is finite it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite as well, and thus countable. If $f(S)$ is not countable then there is a bijection from $f(s)\to \mathbb{N}$.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because we have bijections from $S\to f(S)$ and from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$, there also exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, making $S$ countable.

Now we consider the case where there is a surjection $g:\mathbb{N}\to T$. Consider the class of sets $X_{t}:=\{ n \in\mathbb{N}|g(n)=t \}$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] $X_{t}$ will always have a least element. Thus we construct the set $N:=\{t\in T|min({ X_{t} })\}$. 

If we consider the same $g$, but tweak the domain to $N$ instead of $\mathbb{N}$, it will now be 1-1, because the least element of a set is unique. Thus it is both 1-1 and onto, giving a bijection from $N\to T$. Because $N \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ there is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to N$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because there are bijections from $\mathbb{N} \to N$ and from $N\to T$ there must also be a bijection from $N\to T$, making $T$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets with $T$ countable. If there exists an injection $f:S\to T$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:T\to S$, then $S$ is countable.

Consider the function $\hat{f}:S\to f(S)$ where the only difference between $f$ and $\hat{f}$ is their codomain. $\hat{f}$ is a bijection, and because $f(S)\subseteq T$, it must be countable ([[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]]). If $f(S)$ is finite, then it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite (and thus countable) as well. If $f(S)$ is not finite, then there exists a bijection between $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. Thus there is a bijection from $S\to f(S)$ as well as from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, thus making $S$ countable.

Consider the set $X_{s}:=\{t\in T|g(t)=s\}$. Now we construct the set $T':=\{min(X_{s})|s \in S\}$. Because the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] guarantees that there is only one least element, the function $\hat{g}:T'\to S$ is 1-1 as well as onto, making it a bijection. $T'\subseteq T$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]] $T'$ is countable. We now have a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to T'$ and from $T'\to S$. Thus by the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, making $S$ countable.

##### Lemma 1.20
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so are $A\cup  B$ and $A \times B$.

First we will prove that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $A$ and $B$ are countable there exists bijection $f$ and $g$ such that any element in $A$ or $B$ can be represented as
$
\displaylines{
a_{n}=f(n)\\
b_{n}=g(n)
}
$
Let's create a new function $h:\mathbb{N}\to A\cup B$
$
\begin{align}
h(n)&=a_{\frac{n}{2}}\qquad \text{n is even} \\
h(n)&=b_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\qquad \text{ n is odd}
\end{align}
$
By theorem [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 18|#Theorem 1 18]] we only must show that $h$ is onto in order to show that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $f$ and $g$ are countable we know any element in set $A$ can be represented as $a_{n}$ and any element in set $B$ can be represented as $b_{n}$. Thus any element of $A\cup B$ can be represented as either $a_{n}$ or $b_{n}$.

For an arbitrary $b_{n}$, $h(2n-1)$ will map to $b_{n}$. For an arbitrary $a_{n}$, $h(2n)$ will map to $a_{n}$. Thus the function is onto and we have proved that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Next we must prove that $A\times B$ is countable as well. We will again use the countability of $A$ and $B$ to represent an arbitrary element of them as $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ respectively.

I don't want to write out the whole rest of the proof, but the following picture should give a good idea that there is a bijection from $N\to A\cup B$.

To prove this we will invoke [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]] to say that $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is countable. Consider the function $f:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{N}^{2}$
$
f(q)=(a,b)\qquad \text{ Where a/b=q and is in lowest form}
$

If we show this function to be injective, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 19|#Corollary 1 19]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

Suppose there exists an two rational numbers such that where $q_{1}=\frac{a}{b}\neq \frac{x}{y}=q_{2}$, but $(a,b)=(x,y)$. The second statement, by definition, means that $a=x$ and $b=y$. but if that is true, then $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{x}{y}$ thus we have contradiction, meaning $f$ must be injective, and $\mathbb{Q}$ must be countable.

##### Theorem 1.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable

This proof is really beefy and I don't want to write it down. The skeleton in the book is very thorough and filling in the gaps should not be difficult.

##### Definition 1.23
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **uncountable** if and only if it is fails to satisfy [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 12|#Definition 1 12]]

In other words, for some set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is no bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, and the set is not finite.

##### Definition 1.24
> [!none] 
> If $p$ is an upper bound for a set $S$ and $p \in S$ then we say $p$ is a maximum element of $S$ (denoted $p=max(S)$). The definition for a minimum element is constructed similarly.

##### Definition 1.26
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above. A number $\alpha$ is a least upper bound for $S$ if and only if
> 1. $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $S$ and
> 2. if $y<\alpha$, then there exists some $x \in S$ such that $y<x\leq \alpha$.

Alternatively, for some number $\alpha$ to be the least upper bound for a set, then it must be both greater than or equal to every element in the set, and less than or equal to every other upper bound for $S$.

##### Exercise 1.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=\left\{  0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \dots \right\}$. Is $10$ an upper bound of $S$? Is $2$ an upper bound? What is the least upper bound for $S$? Does $S$ have a maximum element?

For all $n \in N$
$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n}&>0\\
-\frac{1}{n}&<0 \\
1-\frac{1}{n}&<1<10
\end{align}
$
Therefore $10$ is an upper bound for $S$. By the same argument $2$ is as well.

In the last step we showed that $1-\frac{1}{n}<1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $1$ is an upper bound for $S$. Consider any number $y<1$. by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\exists m \in \mathbb{N}| \frac{1}{m}<1-y$. Thus from rearranging that inequality we get
$
y<1-\frac{1}{m}
$
Because $m$ is a natural number, the term on the right will be an element of the set. Thus we have shown that for any $y<1$ there exists a number $>y$ and less than $1$ in $S$. Thus by the definition of a supremum $1$ is the least upper bound of $S$.

##### Lemma 1.28
> [!none] 
> If a nonempty set in $S$ has a least upper bound, then that least upper bound is unique. In other words, $S$ cannot have two different least upper bounds.

Suppose we have two numbers $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ that are least upper bounds for a set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We will argue that they must be the same number by contradiction. If they were not, then WLOG $x<y$. But $x$ is an upper bound, so $y$ cannot be the least upper bound if $x$ is less than it. Thus we have our contradiction and every least upper bound is unique.

##### Definition 1.29

##### Axiom 1.30 (The Axiom of Completeness)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$. Equivalently: Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 1.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Why are the two statements of the Axiom of Completeness equivalent?

For some some $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded blow, consider the set $B:=\{b \in \mathbb{R}|\forall x \in S, b\leq x\}$. This set is bounded above by every element of $S$, so the Axiom of Completeness says $m=\text{ sup}(B)$ must exists. Because every element in $S$ is an upper bound for $B$, $m\leq S$. Because $B$ is the set of upper bounds for $S$, by definition of a least upper bound, $m>$ every bound for $S$. Thus is satisfies both the criteria to be greatest lower bound for $S$.

The exact same process can be carried out to show that if we assume a set bounded below has a greatest lower bound, then any set must have a greatest upper bound. Thus the two formulations of the Axiom of Completeness are the same.

##### Exercise 1.35
> [!none] 
> Prove or disprove: $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite

In this proof we will rely on the results of [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 22|#Theorem 1 22]], [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 21|#Theorem 1 21]], and [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]], which state, respectively, that
1. $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable,
2. $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, and
3. The union of two countable sets is countable as well.

We will prove that $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is not countable by contradiction. Assume that it is countable. Now consider the set $\mathbb{Q}\cup \mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$. Because both of these sets are countable, their union must be as well. But we know what their union is; by definition it must be $\mathbb{R}$, which is uncountable. Thus we have our contradiction and the irrationals must be uncountable.

2. Yes it is. For any natural number $n$, $2=2$ and $7+\frac{1}{n+1}<7+\frac{1}{n}$.

4. Yes it is. For any natural number $n$, $0=0$ and $\frac{1}{n+1}< \frac{1}{n}$

##### Theorem 1.39 (The Nested Interval Property)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $\{ I_{n} \}$ is a collection of nested, nonempty intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{R}$. Then the collection $\{ I_{n} \}$ has a nonempty intersection—in other words, there exists $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p$ is an element of $I_{n}$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

Consider the set $A:=\{n \in \mathbb{N}| a_{n} \}$. We know that $b_{1}$ is an upper bound on this set, because for any $a_{n}$, $b_{n}$ is greater than it, and $b_{1}<b_{n}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}>1$. Thus we can invoke the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness|#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness]] and say that $a=\text{ sup}(A)$ exists.

By the definition of a supremum, $a\geq a_{n}$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$a$ must also be less than or equal to every $b_{n}$. To show this fact we must first prove that any $b_{k}$ is greater than $a_{i}$ $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. If this were not the case, and there were some $a_{i}$ such that $a_{i}>b_{k}$, then there must also be an $b_{i}$ such that $b_{i}>a_{i}$. But this would mean that all elements in the $i$th interval are greater than all elements in the $k$th interval, so neither could be a subset of the other. Thus every $b_{n}$ must be greater than every $a_{i}$. Using this fact, if $a>b_{k}$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then there would be another upper bound, $b_{k}$, which is less than $a$, contradicting the definition of a supremum.

Therefore
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n}\qquad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
$
By construction thus must mean that $a$ is in every interval $I_{n}$.

##### Exercise 1.40
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Note that the hypothesis in the statement of the Nested Interval Property includes the assumption that each interval looks like $[a_{n},b_{n}]$. Would the theorem be hold for other types of nonempty intervals?

Nothing would change in our argument until the last line. 
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n} \qquad \forall  n \in \mathbb{N}
$

But this only implies that $a$ must be in the set $[a_{n}, b_{n}]$ *because the endpoints are included*. If instead it was in the form $(a_{n},b_{n}]$, or $(a_{n},b_{n})$, then we could have $a=a_{n}$, which would satisfy the inequality above, but not be included in those sets.

Consider the intervals $I_{n}=$ $\left( 0, \frac{1}{n} \right]$. For any number there will always be a $\frac{1}{n}$ smaller than it ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]]), so there will be a set it is not included in. This is only possible because the supremum of the left endpoints = 0, and because they are open intervals $0$ is not included in any of them.

##### Example 1.41
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ represent the trunction of $\pi$to $n$ decimal places, and let $b_{n}=a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}$. Then define $J_{n}=[a_{n},b_{n}]$. It follows that

> $
> Show that $J_{1}\subseteq J_{2}\subseteq J_{3}\dots$ Now define $I_{n}=J_{n}\cap \mathbb{Q}$. In a world consisting of only rational numbers, $\{ I_{n} \}$ constitutes a collection of nonempty, nested intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{Q}$. Does it follow that there is some number $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p$ is an element in **every** $I_{n}$?

For any natural number $n$, $\frac{1}{10^{n}}>0$, so $a_{n}<b_{n}$. $a_{n+1}$ must be greater than $a_{n}$ (or, if the next decimal is 0, equal to $a_{n}$), because it is just $a_{n}$ plus the next decimal. $b_{n+1}=a_{n+1}+\frac{1}{10^{n+1}}<a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}=b_{n}$. Therefore each successive interval must be a subset of the last.

No, it does not imply that there will be a rational number $p$ that is in the intersection of every one of these sets. The Nested Interval Property only implies that there will be a **real number** such that it is in the intersection of all of the sets.

##### Exercise 1.50*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number.

We must show that for any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ where $a<b$ there exists a rational number $q$ such that $a<q<b$.

First, consider the case where $0\leq a<b$.

From [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we know that there exists a $n \in \mathbb{N}|$ $0<\frac{1}{n} < \left| b-a \right|$. Let $q=\frac{1}{n}$, where $q$ is clearly rational.

Consider the set $S=\{n \in \mathbb{N}|b\leq n\cdot q\}$. Because $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] allows us to produce an $m =min(S)$. $m-1$ must not be in $S$, otherwise $m$ would not be the least element of $S$ (we are guaranteed that it is in the naturals because $q<b$, so 1 cannot be the least element, thus $m-1\geq1$). By the construction of $S$ this implies that $(m-1)\cdot q <b$. 

$m$ must be in $S$, by the definition of a least element. This implies $mq\geq  b$.
$
\begin{align}
mq&\geq b \\
mq-q&\geq b-q>b-(b-a) \qquad \text{because }q<b-a\\ 
(m-1)q&>a
\end{align}
$
Therefore we have $a<(m-1)q<b$. Because $q$ is rational and $m-1$ is a natural number, $(m-1)q$ must be rational as well, and we have thus proved for any $0\leq a<b$ there is a rational number in between $a$ and $b$.

The case where $a<0<b$ is trivial because by construction $0$ a rational number within the interval.

Lastly we consider the case where $a<b\leq0$. Consider the interval between $-b$ and $-a$. Because $a,b$ are negative, $-a,-b$ must be positive and so we can use our previous work to produce a number $q \in Q|-b<q<-a$. negating this inequality produces $a<-q<b$, which is the desired result.

Thus for any $a$ and $b$ there will always be a rational number in between them.

##### Exercise 1.51*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $a<b$, then the open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] each of them will produce a unique rational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of rationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Corollary 1.52*
> [!none] 
> - [x] Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one irrational number.

We will prove this statement by contradiction. Assume it is false, and there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that in between them there are **no** irrational numbers. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there exists a $b \in \mathbb{Q}|a<q<b$. Consider an arbitrary $x \in (a-q,b-q)$.
$
\begin{align}
a-q&<x<b-q \\
a&<x+q<b
\end{align}
$
Therefore $x+q \in (a,b)$ and by our initial assumption $x+q$ is rational. But $q$ is rational, so $(x+q)-q=x$ must be rational as well. Thus all elements in the set $(a-q,b-q)$ are rational. From now on let $a'=a-q$ and $b'=b-q$.

Now consider the interval $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$, for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $s \in (n\cdot a', n\cdot b')$
$
\begin{align}
n\cdot a' < s < n\cdot b' \\
a'< \frac{s}{n}<b'
\end{align}
$
Therefore $\frac{s}{n} \in (a',b')$ and is rational. But if $\frac{s}{n}$ is rational, then $\frac{s}{n} \cdot n=s$ must be rational as well. Thus any element of an interval of the form $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ will be rational.

Here we will take a moment to remember that
$
\begin{align}
a&<q<b \\
a'=a-q&<0<b-q=b'
\end{align}
$
$n$ is any arbitrary natural number, so as we increase $n$ it will have the effect of scaling up this interval to any desired size while keeping all its members rational. This allows us to show that irrational numbers don't exist, which is obviously false. But for the sake of precision let us take a specific natural number for our contradiction.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there will be an $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m> \frac{3}{b'}$. Therefore $b' \cdot m >3$. $m\cdot b'>3>\sqrt{ 3 }$, and $\sqrt{ 3 }>0>a'\cdot m$. This implies that $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is in the interval $(m\cdot a',m\cdot b')$, making it rational. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 32|#Theorem 1 32]] $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational, giving us our contradiction and completing the proof.

##### Exercise 1.53*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  if $a<b$, then the interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many irrational number.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 52|#Exercise 1 52]] each of them will produce a unique irrational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of irrationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Exercise 1.54 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove that if $z$ is an upper bound for $A$, and $z \in A$, then it must be true that $z=sup(A)$.

- Because $z$ is already established as an upper bound, the only thing which we have to show is that $z\leq b$, where $b$ is any other upper bound.
- We will prove by contradiction
- Assume there is an upper bound $b<z$ outside of the set. But since $z$ is in the set it is not an upper bound. Therefore we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.55*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Archimedean Principle was presented as an axiom. Show that, in fact, the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

Arch: For any b in the Real Numbers there exists a natural number $n > b$.

Axiom: For any nonempty subset of R which is bounded above there exists a least upper bound.

We will prove this by contradiction. Our initial assumption is that the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle, which is logically equivalent to the Archimedean Principle being true and the Axiom of Completeness being false.

Let us assume that the Axiom of Completeness is true and that the Archimedean Principle is not true.

That the Archimedean Principle is not true implies that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \ngtr b$. Then $b$ would be an upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$. By the Axiom of Completeness, $\mathbb{N}$ must have a least upper bound as it is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and it is bounded above.

Let us call this least upper bound $m$. If $m$ is a least upper bound, then $m - 1$ cannot be a bound to $\mathbb{N}$. Since $m - 1$ is not an upper bound, that implies that $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} | n > m - 1$. This in turn implies that $m < n + 1$. However, because the $\mathbb{N}$ are closed under addition, $n + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and because $m$ is now shown to be less than a natural number, it cannot be the least upper bound. This is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be false. That the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle is untrue. We have therefore proven that the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

##### Exercise 1.56*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Axiom of Completeness stipulates, in a very specific way, that the set of real number, $\mathbb{R}$, completes the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$. To appreciate this, suppose that you are working in a number universe consisting of only rational numbers. Show that there does exist a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $S$ has a rational upper bound and yet $S$ has no rational least upper bound.

Consider the set $S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} | x \cdot x < 2\}$.

Let us find the least upper bound $s$ of the set $S$. We propose $\sqrt{2}$ as $s$, and will show that both $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ and that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

First let us demonstrate that $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ with a proof by contradiction. Suppose $\exists x \in S | x > \sqrt{2}$. Then $x^{2} > 2$, and by the definition of $S$, $S$ cannot contain $x$. Thus, our initial assumption must be false, and $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$.

Second let us demonstrate that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$, also with a proof by contradiction. Let us then suppose that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | b < s$. Then by the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ proved in exercise 1.5, we know that $\exists n \in \mathbb{Q} | b < n < s$. From this we know that $n^{2} < s^{2}$, or that $n^{2} < 2$. Since $n \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $n^{2} < 2$, by definition of $S$, $n \in S$. Because $n \in S$ and $n > b$, $b$ cannot be an upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; therefore $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

Therefore, $s = \sqrt{2}$ is the least upper bound of $S$. It should be clear that $S$ has no end of rational upper bounds; however $S$ has a irrational least upper bound.

##### Exercise 1.57*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose that $p$ is a prime number. Show that there is no rational number $z$ that satifies $z^{2}=p$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose there is a $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\frac{a}{b} = z$ and $z^{2}=p$, and $\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest form.
$
\begin{align}
\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{2} &= p \\
a^{2} &= pb^{2}
\end{align}
$
From this statement we can see that $p$ is a factor of $a$. If it were not then $a^{2}$ would not have it as a factor either, which it clearly does. Thus we can write $a = px$, where $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
$
\begin{align}
(px)^{2} &= pb^{2} \\
px^{2} &= b^{2}
\end{align}
$
By the same argument we can see that $p$ is also a factor of $b$. But if $p$ is a factor of both $b$ and $a$, then $\frac{a}{b}$ is not in lowest form, and we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.58*

Let $s$ be the least upper bound of the set $S=\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^{2} < p\}$.

Let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$. We begin by assuming that $s^{2} < p$.

Consider $(s + \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s + \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon < 1$, $\epsilon^{2} < \epsilon$, and since $p > s$:

$
\begin{gather*}
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1)
\end{gather*}
$

Let us now choose an $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2}$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2} \\
	s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p
\end{gather*}
$

From our initial comparison $s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon$ and $s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p$ we may conclude that $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$.

Since $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$, $(s + \epsilon) \in S$ and $(s + \epsilon) > s$. Therefore, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$ and we have run into a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong and $s^{2} \nless p$.

Now let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \ngtr p$. Let us then initially assume that $s^{2} > p$.

Consider $(s - \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s - \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon$, $s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon$. Let us then choose an $\epsilon$ such that $s \epsilon < s^{2} - p$. Then $s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$, $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$, $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ by the definition of $S$. Since $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ and it is smaller than $s$, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be incorrect and $s^{2} \ngtr p$.

Since we have shown through contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$ and $s^{2} \ngtr p$, $s^{2}$ must equal $p$. Thus $s$ is a real number which satisfies $s^{2} = p$.

##### Exercise 1.59 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $S$ is a bounded nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Define the related set $T =\{ -x|x \in S \}$. Prove that $T$ is bounded and that $\text{sup}(T)=-\text{inf}(S)$ and $\text{inf}(T)=-\text{sup}(S).$

- Show that $-\text{inf(S)}$ is an upper bound for T
- Show that the negative of the set of all the lower bounds of T is the same as the set of all of the upper bounds for t. 
- Show that the negative of every lower bound  is an upper bound.
- Since inf(T) is greater than every lower bound the negative of both with mean -inf(T) is less than every upper bound.
- Thus it is both greater than every element in the set, and it is less than every bound, making it = sup(T).

#### 2.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 2.1
> [!none] 
> Given a point $p \in \mathbb{R}$, and a number $\epsilon$, the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $p$ (sometimes written as the $\epsilon$-nbdh of $p$) is the set of points whose distance from $p$ is less than $\epsilon$. Notationally, this is written as $N_{p}:=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}:\left| x-p \right|<\epsilon \}$.

##### Exercise 2.2
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $a<b$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $S=(a,b)$. Prove that for each $c \in S$, there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(c)\subseteq S$. (Is this true if we used $S=(a,b]$?)

Let $\epsilon = min\left\{  \frac{\left| c-a \right|}{2}, \frac{\left| b-c \right|}{2}  \right\}$. 
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $a$:
$
c-\frac{c-a}{2}=\frac{c}{2} + \frac{a}{2}> \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}>a \\
$
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $b$:
$
c+ \frac{b-c}{2}=\frac{b}{2}+\frac{c}{2}< \frac{b}{2}+\frac{b}{2}=b
$
From these cases it is clear that $\forall x \in N_{\epsilon}$ will be inside $S$. This is not true for the interval $S=(a,b]$ because $b+\epsilon>b$ for any value of $\epsilon>0$.

##### Definition 2.3 
> [!none] 
> For $\epsilon>0$, the set $N_{e}^{*}:=N_{\epsilon}\text{ \\ }\{ p \}$ is called the **deleted $\epsilon$-neighborhood** of $p$.

2. $N_{0.02}^{*}(4)=(3.98,4)\cup (4,4.02)$
3. $N_{\epsilon}(4)=(4-\epsilon,4+\epsilon)$
4. $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)=(4-\epsilon,4)\cup(4,4+\epsilon )$

##### Exercise 2.5

1. $3.99\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)$ and $3.99 \in S$.
2. If $\epsilon<12$: $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)$ and $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in S$. If $\epsilon\geq 12$: $3.99\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)$ and $3.99 \in S$

##### Definition 2.6
> [!none]
> Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be a set, and let $p \in\mathbb{R}$. We say that $p$ is an **accumulation point** of $S$ if and only if, for all $\epsilon>0$, the intersection $S\cap N_{\epsilon}^{*}(p)$ is nonempty. We will use $S'$ to denote the set of all accumulation points of $S$, ie

##### Exercise 2.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that 2 is an accumulation point of the set $[0,2)$

For any $2>\epsilon>0$ the point $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $2-\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in (0,2]$. If $\epsilon\geq2$ the point $1 \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}$ and $1 \in (0,2]$. Therefore, by definition $2$ is an accumulation point of the set $(0,2]$

##### Exercise 2.8
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that $\pi$ is an accumulation point of $Q$. 

Given an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there will be a rational number in between the interval $(\pi,\epsilon)\subseteq N_{\epsilon}^{*}(\pi )$.

##### Exercise 2.9 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  What does it mean for a point p to not be an accumulation point of a set $S$? Show that neither $2$ nor $\pi$ are accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

It means that there exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that there are no points in the set within that $\epsilon$ radius of $p$.

For example, take $\epsilon=0.1$. There are no integers in the sets $(1.9,2.1)\text{ \\ }\{ 2 \}$ or the set $(\pi-0.1,\pi+0.1)\text{ \\ }\{ \pi \}$. Thus they are no accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

#### 2.2 Main Theorems

##### Definition 2.10
> [!none] 
> Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$. The **closure** of $S$ is the set that is created by taking $S$ along with its accumulation points. We use the notation
> $
> cl(S):=S\cup S'.
> $

##### Definition 2.11
> [!none] 
> Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$ We say that $S$ is a **closed set** if and only if $S=cl(S)$.

##### Exercise 2.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that $S$ is closed if and only if $S'\subseteq S$.

Proof by contradiction: If this were false there would be an element $x \in S'$ and $x \cancel{ \in } S$ and $S$ would have to be closed. This would mean that $x \in S\cup S'$, but we have already established that $x$ is not in $S$, therefore $S\neq S\cup S'$, meaning it is not closed, and we have a contradiction. 

##### Exercise 2.13
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $S=(0,4)$. Show that $0,4,$ and $2$ are all accumulation points of $S$.

1. $0$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(0)\cap(0,4)$.
2. $4$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $4-\frac{\epsilon}{2} \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(4)\cap(0,4)$
3. $2$: For any $\epsilon>0$, $2+\epsilon \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(2)\cap(0,4)$ 

##### Exercise 2.14

$cl(S)=[0,4]$

##### Theorem 2.15
> [!none]
> - [>]  Let $A,B\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $(A\cup B)'$, then $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$.

We will prove by contraposition. The above statement is logically equivalent to: if $x \notin A'$ and $x \notin B'$, then $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

By the definition of $x$ not being in $A'$, there exists a $\epsilon$ such that $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap A$ is an empty set. Likewise there must exists a $\delta$ such that $N_{\delta }^{*}(x)\cap B$ is empty as well. WLOG $\delta<\epsilon$. Because $N_{\delta}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\epsilon  }^{*}(x)$ there are no points from $A$ *or* $B$ that are in the deleted delta-neighborhood of $x$. This is is essentially the definition of what it means for $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

##### Corollary 2.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of two closed sets is closed.

Let $A$ and $B$ both be closed sets. For any $x \in (A\cup B)'$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 15|#Theorem 2 15]] $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$. But because $A$ and $B$ are closed $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$, and thus $A',B' \subseteq A\cup B$, and $x \in A\cup B$. This shows that $(A\cup B)'\subseteq A\cup B$, which by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] makes $A\cup B$ closed.

##### Lemma 2.16.1
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $(a,b)\cap S'$ is nonempty, then $(a,b)\cap S$ is nonempty as well

From the hypothesis of the statement, we know there exists an element $x \in (a,b)$ and $x \in S'$. Because $x \in S'$ there must then exists $y \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ for all $\epsilon>0$. Let $c=min(\{ \left| b-x \right|,\left| x-a \right| \})$. Consider an $\epsilon|\epsilon<c$. $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)=(x-c,x+c)$. By the construction of $c$, $x-c\geq a$ and $x+c\leq b$. This implies that $y$ must be in $(a,b)$. Thus we have produced an element $y \in (a,b)\cap S$.

##### Theorem 2.17
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Given any set $S$, the set $S'$ is a closed set

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] we must show that $S''\in S'$. This means that if $y \in S''$, for an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ we must produce an element $x$ such that $x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$.

By definition of $y \in S''$, $\forall \delta >0$ $N_{\delta}^{*}(y)\cap S'\neq \emptyset$. Let $\delta=\epsilon$ in this case. Because the set is nonempty we can product an element $z$ inside of it. By construction this $z \in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon)$ and $z \in S'$. Because $z \in S'$ we can produce an $x$ such that for an arbitrary $\alpha$, $N_{\alpha}^{*}(z)\cap S\neq \emptyset$. Because $\delta$ is arbitrary, if we set it $=min\{ \left| (y+\epsilon) -z \right|, \left| z- (y-\epsilon) \right| \}$ $x$ is guaranteed to be in the interval $(y-\epsilon, y+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because $x$ must also be in $S$ we have assured that for an arbitrary $\epsilon$ $\exists x|x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$. Thus that set is not empty and we have accomplished our goal.

##### Corollary 2.18
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Given a set $S \subseteq  R$, the set $cl(S)$ is a closed set.

By definition $cl(S):=S\cup S'$. Given any accumulation point of $cl(S)'$ we must show that it is in $cl(S)$ ([[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). If $y \in cl(S)'$ then for all $\epsilon>0$ there $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap(S\cup S')$ must be nonempty. This is logically equivalent to $(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S)\cup(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')\neq \emptyset$. This means that there exists a $z$ such that $z \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ *or* $z \in (N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')$. If the first case is true, then by definition $y \in S'$. In the second case, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 2 16 1|#Lemma 2 16 1]] $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ must be nonempty, which again by definition makes $y \in S'$. Thus we have showed that for any point in $cl(S)'$, it must also be in $cl(S)=S\cup S'$, and by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]], it must be closed

##### Theorem 2.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of a finite number of closed sets is a closed set.

We must show that for any natural number $n\leq2$ the union of $n$ closed sets are closed.

Base case: for $n=2$, we simply have to refer to [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]].

Inductive hypothesis: Suppose that the union of $n$ closed sets is closed. We must show that the union of $n+1$ sets is closed.

By the inductive hypothesis for any sequence of closed sets $\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}$ is closed. $\cup_{i=2}^{n+1}C_{i}=\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}\cup C_{n+1}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]] this must also be closed, and by mathematical induction the union of any finite set of closed intervals will be closed as well.

##### Theorem 2.20
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The intersection of any collection of closed sets is a closed set.

Suppose $\{S_{i}\}$ is a collection of closed sets, either finite or infinite. We must show that if for all values of $i$ $S_{i}$ will be closed, then the intersection of all of these sets is closed. We will do this through contradiction. 

Assume that the theorem is false, and there exists a collection of sets $S_{i}$ which are all closed, yet their intersection (denoted $\cap S_{i}$) is not closed. $\cap S_{i}$ not being closed implies that $(\cap S_{i})'\nsubseteq\cap S_{i}$ (by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). Thus
$
\begin{align}
\exists x &\in (\cap S_{i})'|x \notin S_{i}, \text{ where }S_{i}\text{ is at least one of the sets}\\
\forall \epsilon&>0(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap(\cap S_{i})\neq \emptyset)
\end{align}
$
This implies that for any $S_{i}$, $N_{\epsilon^{*}}(x)\cap S_{i}\neq0$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point for every $S_{i}$. Because each $S_{i}$ is closed this guarantees that $x \in S_{i}$, for all $S_{i}$ as well, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]'s formulation of the definition of being closed. But this contradicts what we said earlier, finishing our proof.

##### Exercise 2.30*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if every nonempty interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.

Let $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. From the definition of dense, we know that $\mathbb{R}\subseteq\text{cl}(S)$, or equivalently, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. This means that every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is either an element of $S$ or is an accumulation point of $S$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $x\in\mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $S$, then we know that $(a,b)$ contains an element of $S$. If $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, then we know for some $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. In other words, the deleted neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one element of $S$. If $\epsilon<\text{min}\{|x-a|,|x-b|\}$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\subseteq (a,b)$. This means that at least one element of $S$ is also in $(a,b)$.

Therefore, if $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, then every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.


Suppose now that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S. This means for some distinct $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ where $\epsilon>0$ and some distinct $x\in\mathbb{R}$, the intervals $(x-\epsilon,x)$ and $(x,x+\epsilon)$ will each contain an element of $S$.

We can see that $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^*(x)$, and since there is at least two elements of $S$ in $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. This means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.

Since every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be described as an accumulation point of $S$, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. Therefore if every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S, then $S$ is dense in $R$.
 
##### Corollary 2.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  $Q$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

In order for $\mathbb{Q}$ to be dense in $\mathbb{R}$, it must be the case that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, since between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number. This means every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 2.38*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use induction to prove that $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, each of length $(\frac{1}{3})^{n}$.

Base case: $C_{0}$ is the closed interval $[0,1]$ which clearly has length $1=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{0}$ , and there is only one interval ($1=2^{0}$). Thus the base case checks out.

Inductive hypothesis: We assume that $C_{n}$ has a $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, and we must show that $C_{n+1}$ has $2^{n+1}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

In definition of the Cantor set we were told that to construct the next "partial Cantor set" set you take each interval of the previous set and remove the open third of the interval. When you do this you split each interval into two intervals, doubling the number of intervals. Thus if $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, $C_{n+1}$ will have $2^{n}\cdot2=2^{n+1}$ intervals. When the middle third of each interval is removed the split intervals will have $\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the interval they were split from. So if each interval in $C_{n}$ has length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, then each interval in $C_{n+1}$ will have length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified, and by induction for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $C_{n}$ will have $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

##### Exercise 2.39*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Find at least three distinct points in the Cantor Set.

When we remove the middle third of each interval the endpoints of each interval are never removed. Thus an endpoint for $C_{n}$ will be an endpoint for every $C_{m}$ where $m>n$. In addition, because every $C_{n}$ is a subset of every $C_{l}$ where $l<n$, every endpoint of $C_{n}$ will be contained in $C_{l}$. Thus any endpoint of any of the sets will be in the Cantor set. Consider the set $\left\{  0,1, \frac{1}{3}  \right\}$. All the elements in the set are endpoints of $C_{1}$, so they must be in the Cantor set.

##### Exercise 2.40*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor Set is a closed set.

Every $C_{n}$ is a union of a finite number of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]] every $C_{n}$ is closed. Because $C_{\infty}$ is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, which are all closed, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $C_{\infty}$ must be closed as well.

##### Exercise 2.41*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor set is nowhere **dense**.

To be nowhere dense there must be no $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. We will prove this by contradiction.

Assume there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. Because the Cantor set is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, $(a,b)$ must be a subset of every $C_{n}$. Let $c= \left| a-b \right|$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] for some natural number $m$, $\frac{1}{m}<c$. $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{m}< \frac{1}{m}$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $C_{n}$ it will be made up of intervals of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. Thus we can produce a $C_{m}$ which is the union of a disjoint set of intervals, each of which are smaller than $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)$ cannot be a subset of $C_{m}$, otherwise $C_{m}$ would contain an interval larger than $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. This is contradiction, showing that our initial assumption is false, and the Cantor set must be **nowhere dense**.

### Chapter 3

#### 3.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 3.1
> [!none] 
> Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. A point $p \in S$ is said to be an interior point of $S$ if and only if there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(p)\subseteq S$. The set of all interior points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as the interior of $S$) will be denoted by $S^{\circ}$.

##### Definition 3.2
> [!none] 
> A point $q \in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}(q)$ contains at least one element of $S$ and at least one element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. The set of all boundary points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as **the boundary of $S$**) will be denoted by $\partial(S)$.

##### Exercise 3.3 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For a set $S \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\partial (S)=\partial (\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

If $T= \mathbb{R}\setminus S$, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus T=S$. For every boundary point no matter how small of an interval around that point there is there must be an element of $S$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But any element of $S$ is an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus T$, and every element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is an element of $T$. Therefore the point must be a boundary point for $T=\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well. Showing the implication the other way is very simple.

##### Exercise 3.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $S'$ is a subset of $\partial(S)$.

This is false. Consider the set $(0,1)$. $\frac{1}{2}$ is an accumulation point, but not a boundary point.

##### Exercise 3.5
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $\partial(S)$ is a subset of $S'$.

This is also false. Consider the set $\{ 1 \}$. In this set $1$ is a boundary point, but not an accumulation point. I believe if the definition of a boundary point was a deleted epsilon neighborhood instead of a regular epsilon neighborhood, then this would be true.

##### Theorem 3.9
> [!none] 
> - [>]  An interval of the form $(a,b):=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}|a<x<b \}$ is an open set.

The definition of an interior point makes it clear that it must be an element of the set. Thus we only have to show that $(a,b)\subseteq (a,b)^{\circ}$.

For any point $x \in (a,b)$, if you take $\varepsilon=min\{ \left| x-a \right|,\left| b-x \right| \}$, then the interval $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will be contained in the set, making $x$ an interior point of $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)=(a,b)^{\circ}$.

##### Exercise 3.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: the set $\mathbb{R}$, as well as the empty set $\emptyset$, are both open and closed.

We will prove this statement true.

The empty set has no interior points, so it is equal to its interior, making it technically open. It also has no accumulation points, so they must be a subset of the set, making it also closed.

For any real number, any open interval containing the number will be a subset of the real numbers. This makes every real number part of the interior of $\mathbb{R}$, and thus making it open. Every accumulation point of $\mathbb{R}$ must be in $\mathbb{R}$, making it closed as well. 

##### Exercise 3.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $T$ is not open, then $T$ is closed.

We will prove this false. Consider the set $(0,1]$. This set is not open, but it is also not closed, providing a counterexample to the statement.

#### 3.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 3.13
> [!none] 
> - [>]  A set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. In other words, a set $S$ is open if and only if no boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

First we prove the forward direction: If $S$ is open, then all of the boundary are not elements of $S$.

For any $x \in \partial(S)$ by definition for all $\varepsilon>0$ the neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain a point in $S$ and a point not is $S$. Thus $N_{\varepsilon}$ cannot be a subset of $S$ because it contains an element not in $S$, meaning the point is not in the interior of $S$.

Next we prove the backward direction: If no boundary points are elements of $S$, then $S$ is an open set.

We will prove this by contraposition. The following statement is logically equivalent to the problem statement: If $S$ is not open, then there exists a boundary point which is an element of $S$.

If $S$ is not open that means there exists a point $x \in S|x \notin S^{\circ}$. Therefore for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain an element not in $S$. But because $x \in S$ it contains both a point in $S$, and a point not in $S$, making it a boundary point in $S$.

##### Lemma 3.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $S'\setminus S=\partial(S)\setminus S$.

Suppose $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain a point in $S$ because $x\in S'$. But because the neighborhood contains $x$, it also contains a point not in $S$. Thus it satisfies the criteria to be a boundary point and is not in $S$, so $x \in \partial(S)\setminus S$.

Now suppose $y$ is a boundary point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain one point in $S$ and one point not in $S$. Because $y \notin S$, the point in $S$ must be in $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$ this guarantees that $y \in S'$ by definition. We also know that $y \notin S$, so $y \in S'\setminus S$.

Because we have proved that $S'\setminus S\subseteq \partial(S)\setminus S$ and $\partial(S)\setminus S\subseteq S'\setminus S$, the two sets must be equal.

##### Lemma 3.14.1
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is a boundary point of $S$, and is not contained in $S$, then $x$ is an accumulation point.

By the definition of a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain at least one element of $S$. Because $x \notin S$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain the element of $S$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.
##### Theorem 3.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is a closed set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq S$. In other words, a set $S$ is closed if and only if all boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

Suppose $S$ is closed. We must show that all of its boundary points are elements of $S$. Let $x \in \partial(S)$. 
Suppose $x \notin S$, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 3 14 1|#Lemma 3 14 1]] it would be an accumulation point of $S$. Because $S$ is closed this implies that $x \in S$. This is a contradiction, meaning our assumption must be false and $x$ must be in $S$.

Now suppose all of the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$. We must show that $S$ is closed. Let us do this through contradiction.
Assume that all the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$, but $S$ is not closed. By the definition of $S$ not being closed, there must be a $x \in S'|x\notin S$. This means that for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain an element of $S$. $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ contains an element of $S$. Because it contains $x$ as well, it contains an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well, thus satisfying the definition of a boundary point. This means that $x$ is a boundary point of $S$ not within $S$, contradicting our initial assumption and completing the proof.

##### Corollary 3.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

First we must show the forward direction: If $S\in R$ is an open set, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

If $S$ is open, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $\partial(S)\subseteq(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. Therefore $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. Therefore by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

Now we must show the backward direction: If $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set, then $S$ is an open set.

By definition [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ being closed we know that $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But this implies that $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. So by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $S$ is open.

Q.E.D.

##### Theorem 3.17
> [!none]
> - [x]  The intersection of finitely many open sets is open

Consider $S=\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}S_{i}$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $S_{i}$ is open. Now consider the set $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$. Because $S_{i}$ is open [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]] guarantees $\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$ must be closed. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must then be closed because it is a union of a finite number of closed intervals ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]]). Then again by Corollary 3.16 $S$ must be open if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

##### Theorem 3.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of any collection of open sets is open.

Let $X$ be any collection of open sets. Let our set $S=\bigcup\limits_{O\in S}O$ where every $O \in S$ is open. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcap\limits_{O\in S}\mathbb{R}\setminus O$. Because every $O \in S$ is open, $\mathbb{R}\setminus O$ must be closed by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]]. This means that $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is the intersection of a collection of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must be closed. Because $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed, $S$ must be open by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]].

##### Example 3.19
> [!none] 
> $F=\{ (1,4),(1,2),(3,7) \}$ is a collection of three open sets. Notice that the interval $(1,2)$ is an element of $F$ (not a subset of $F$) so we can write $(1,2)\in F$. At the same time we have that $\{ (1,2) \}\subseteq  F$.

$0 \in [0,1]$ is not in any interval of the form $(0,i)$ where $i \in I=\mathbb{N}$. Thus it is not "covered" by $F$.

##### Exercise 3.23
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set. Show that there exists an open cover of $S$, $F=\{ O_{i}: \in I \}$ such that every open set $O_{i}$ in $F$ is a subset of $S$.

Consider the open set $(0,1)$. If we set $O_{1}=\left( 0, \frac{3}{4} \right)$, and $O_{2}=\left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)$. Note that both sets are subsets of $(0,1)$. Let $I=\{ 1,2 \}$. Let $F=\{ O_{i}|i \in I \}$. $\bigcup\limits_{O \in F}O=(0,1)$ and thus $F$ is an open cover comprised of only subsets of $(0,1)$.

3. Let $I=\mathbb{N}$, and for every $i \in I$ let $O_{i}=(i-1,i+1)$. $F=\{ O_{i}|i \in I \}$.

#### 3.3 Follow Up Work

##### Exercise 3.25
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Develop complete proofs of all the lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Exercise 3.26*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or Disprove: Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S\setminus S'=S\setminus \partial(S)$.

We will prove this statement false. Consider the natural numbers. Clearly the set $N_{0.5}^{*}(1)\cap \mathbb{N}$ empty, and thus by definition $1$ cannot be an accumulation point and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}'$.

We must now show that $1$ *is* a boundary point for $\mathbb{N}$. If we consider any $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ will contain an element of $\mathbb{N}$ (namely, $1$). If we consider the deleted neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(1)=(1-\varepsilon,1+\varepsilon)$, it is an interval, so it must contain an infinite amount of points. But in between any two real numbers ($1-\varepsilon$ and $1+\varepsilon$) there can only be a finite number of natural numbers. Thus there must be elements in the interval which are not in $\mathbb{N}$ and for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ contains an element of the natural numbers, and element not in the natural numbers, satisfying the definition of a boundary point.

Obviously $1\in \mathbb{N}$, so we have show that $1 \in \mathbb{N}\setminus \partial(\mathbb{N})$ and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}\setminus  \mathbb{N}'$. Thus the two sets are not equal and the statement has been disproven.

##### Exercise 3.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ closed and $T$ is open, then $S\cap T$ is not open.

This is false. Consider $S=[0,10]$ and $T=(2,6)$. $S\cap T=(2,6)$, which is open.

##### Exercise 3.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $T\setminus S$ is open.

We will disprove this statement. Let $T=[0,10]$ and $S=(4,6)$. $T\setminus S=[0,4]\cup [6,10]$, which is a closed set.

##### Exercise 3.29*
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $S\setminus T$ is open.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] if we can show for all elements $x \in \partial(S\setminus T)$, $x\notin S\setminus T$, then $S\setminus T$ must be open. $x \notin S\setminus T$ is equivalent to $x \in T \lor x \notin S$.

Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\partial(S\setminus T)$. We must show that $x \in T$, or $x$ is not in $S$ in order to prove that $S\setminus T$ is open. 

By the definition of a boundary point for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $y \in N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ such that $y \in R\setminus(S\setminus T)\Leftrightarrow y \in T \lor y \notin S$.

In the case where $y \notin S$, it is impossible for $x$ to be an interior point. Because $S$ is open, that means that $x \notin S$.
In the case where $y \in T$, we have that $x$ is an accumulation point. Because $T$ is closed, this implies $x \in T$.

Both of these outcomes are sufficient to guarantee that $S\setminus T$ is open.

##### Theorem 3.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $cl(S)=S \cup \partial(S)$.

First we will show that $cl(S)=S\cup S'\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$. Let $x$ be an element of $S\cup S'$. If $x \in S$ then it is clearly also in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Consider the case where $x \notin S$ and $x \in S'$. If we consider neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, it must include an element not in $S$ (namely, $x$), and because it is an accumulation point it must also contain an element *in* $S$. By definition this makes it an accumulation point. Thus every element of $S\cup S'$ is an element of $S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S\cup S'\subseteq S \cup \partial(S)$.

Now we must show that $S\cup \partial(S)\subseteq S\cup S'$. Consider a $y$ in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Again, if $y$ is in $S$ it obviously must be in $S\cup S'$. Consider the case where it is not and $y \in \partial(S)$ and $y \notin S$. Because $y$ is a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$. $y$ is not in $S$, so $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. By definition this makes $y \in S'$ and thus $y \in S\cup S'$.

Thus we have show that $cl(S)\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S \cup \partial(S) \subseteq cl(S)$, so they must be equal.

##### Exercise 3.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=(0,1)$ and let $F=\left\{  \left( 0,1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)|n \in \mathbb{N}  \right\}$. Is $F$ an open cover for $S$? Show that there is no finite subset of $F$ which also covers $S$.

We will prove that $F$ is indeed an open cover for $(0,1)$. 

If we consider any number $x \in (0,1)$, there will always exist an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}<1-x$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]]. Therefore $x<1-\frac{1}{n}$. We also know that $x>0$ (because $x \in (0,1)$), so $x \in \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By construction this means that $x$ is in one of the elements of $S$, and thus must be in the union of all of the elements of $F$. Because $x$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, this implies that $F$ is an open cover for $(0,1)$.

For any finite subset of $F$ which we will call $F'$, consider the set $S=\left\{  n \in \mathbb{N}|\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)\in F'  \right\}$. Because this set is finite we can select a maximal element which we will call $b$. Notice that for every $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$ if $x<y$ then $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{x} \right)\subseteq\left( 0,1-\frac{1}{y} \right)$. We selected $b$ as a maximal element of $S$, so for every interval in $F'$, it must be a subset of $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{b} \right)$. Thus if there is a number which is not in $\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$ it will not be in any element of $F'$.

Now consider the endpoint of that interval $1-\frac{1}{b}$. Because it is an open interval $1-\frac{1}{b}\notin \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$. $b$ is a natural number, so $\frac{1}{b}$ is less than one (in the case where $b=1$ the set would be empty), and greater than zero. Thus $0<1- \frac{1}{b}<1$, and $1- \frac{1}{b} \in (0,1)$. We have produced a number which is in $(0,1)$, but is not "covered" by $F$.

#### 4.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 4.1
> [!none] 
> A function $a:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ is called a sequence. When discussing a sequence, we will typically denote individual elements of the range using subscripts: $a_{i}:=a(1),a_{2}:=a(2)$, etc. We will then denote the entire sequence by $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$, or $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots)$, or simple just by $a_{n}$.

##### Example 4.2
> [!none] 
> The sequence $(n^{2})_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,4,9,16,\dots)$ is the sequence of each of the natural numbers squared. It is clear that the further we go in the sequence, the larger the sequence elements become.

##### Example 4.3
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \sin\left( \frac{\pi n}{2} \right) \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0)$ is a sequence that taeks on the values of $1,0,$ and $-1$ in a repeating pattern. It is clear that the pattern displayed in this sequence will continue forever.

##### Example 4.4
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \frac{n+5}{n} \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has its first few terms as 5,3,7/3,2,9/5,5/3,... It appears that the terms in this sequence are getting smaller; but it is unclear at first glance whether this trend continues. If we look out a bit into the sequence, we see that $a_{100}=\frac{105}{100}=1.05$, and if go really far we see that $a_{8745}\approx 1.00057$. So it seems like the "long-term" behavior of this sequence is to have sequence elements that "get close to" the number 1.

##### Definition 4.5
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to **converge to a number** $L$ if and only if $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$ then $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. In this case, we say that the $(a_{n})$ is a **convergent sequence** and that the number $L$ is a **limit** of the sequence ($a_{n}$).

##### Definition 4.6
> [!none] 
> A sequence ($a_{n}$) is said to **eventually** have a property $P$ if and only if there exists an $N$ such that, whenever $n>N$, $a_{n}$ has property $P$. In other words: ($a_{n}$) eventually has property $P$ if there exists an $N$ such that every term with index greater than $N$ has property $P$.

##### Exercise 4.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }$. Show that $a_{n}$ will eventually be greater than or equal to $10$. 

We will do this through proof by induction.

Base case: $a_{100}=10$.

Inductive hypothesis: $\sqrt{ n+x }$ is always greater than $\sqrt{ n }$ if $x>0$. Thus if if any $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }\geq10$, then $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{ n+1 }$ must be as well. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\geq100$, $a_{n}\leq10$ .

##### Theorem 4.8 (Uniqueness of Limits)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L$, and also converges to a number $M$. Then $L=M$.

$L=M$ if and only if $\left| L-M \right|<0$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. Suppose we choose an $N$ such that if $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $\left| a_{n}-M \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. By the triangle inequality
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-L-(a_{n}-M) \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\left| M-L \right| <\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus $M$ must equal $L$.

##### Example 4.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$.
> 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\frac{1}{n}$ can be smaller than any real number. Consider $\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|=\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ we can produce an $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than it, so the limit must be 0.

##### Example 4.10
> [!none] 
> Use the definition of limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{2n+1}{3n+4}= \frac{2}{3}$.

This proof is not that hard, but very lengthy, so just refer to the books if you need to.

> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}=1$.

$\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}= \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 9|#Example 4 9]] we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{n}=0$, so our limit must equal 1.

##### Exercise 4.12
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Use the definition of limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{4n-5}{n+2}=4$.

This is essentially identical to [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 10|#Example 4 10]]. 
##### Exercise 4.13
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. What does it mean for a number $L$ to not a a limit of $a_{n}$?

If $L$ is a limit of $a_{n}$ that means
$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists N \in\mathbb{N}|\forall n>N (\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon)
$

For $L$ to not be a limit of $a_{n}$ we negate the definition to get
$
\exists\varepsilon>0|\forall N \in\mathbb{N},\exists n>N|(\left| a_{n}-L \right| \geq\varepsilon )
$

In words: There exists an $\varepsilon$ greater than zero such that for all $N$ in the natural numbers there will exists an $n$ greater than $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is not within a distance $\varepsilon$ of $L$.

##### Exercise 4.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,\dots)$ does not converge to the number 1.

Consider an $\varepsilon=0.5$. For any $N$ there will always be an $n$ such that $a_{n}=-1$ and $\left| a_{n}-1 \right|=2\geq0.5$. Thus the definition for not being a limit point as given in the previous exercise has been fulfilled and $1$ is not a limit of the sequence.

#### 4.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 4.15 (First Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B \text{ and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}-b_{n})=A-B.
> \end{align}
> $

$(i)$
Let $\varepsilon>0$.
By definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall n>N_{1},\left| a_{n}-A \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall n>N_{2},\left| b_{n}-B \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\end{align}
$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$. For all $n>N$
$
\begin{align}
&\left| a_{n}+b_{n}-(A+B) \right|= \left| (a_{n}-A)+(b_{n}-B) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-A \right|+\left| b_{n}-B \right|  < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
The triangle allows the first line to be less than or equal to the second line.
By definition this means that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B$.

$(ii)$
Consider the sequence $-b_{n}$. We will show that its limit is $-B$. $\left| -b_{n}-(-B) \right|=\left| B-b_{n} \right|$ which we can make arbitrarily small cause $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$. Then we just use the previous result and add $a_{n}+(-b_{n})$, and their limits will add, meaning $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}-b_{n}=A-B)$

##### Theorem 4.16 (Second Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}\cdot b_{n})=A\cdot B \\
> &\text{ Also, if $B\neq0$, then $b_{n}\neq0$ for sufficiently large n and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \left( \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} \right)=\frac{A}{B}
> \end{align}
> $

$(i)$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}b_{n}-AB \right|&=\left| a_{n}b_{n}-Ab_{n}+Ab_{n}-AB \right|  \\
&= \left| b_{n}(a_{n}-A) +A(b_{n}-B)\right| \\
&\leq \left| b_{n} \right| \left| a_{n} -A\right|+\left| A \right| \left| b_{n}-B \right|   
\end{align}
$

By definition of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ we can make $\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ and $\left| b_{n}-B \right|$ as small as we would like. Thus the only thing we need to show in order to make the expression less than $\varepsilon$ is to show that $b_{n}$ will be bounded, so we can make $\left| b_{n} \right|\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ as small as we would like. A much more fleshed out argument is given in the book.

$(ii)$
The crux of this proof is in the fact that
$
\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right| =\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{B\cdot b_{n}} \right| 
$
and we can make $B-b_{n}$ as small as we want, and $B\cdot b_{n}$ is bounded. Thus $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$, and then we can just think of this as the multiplication of two series.
##### Theorem 4.17 (Order Limit Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence that converges to a limit $A$. If $a_{n}\geq0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq0$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose that $A<0$. By definition of a limit we can produce an $a_{n}$ such that $\left| a_{n}-A \right|<\left| A \right|$. Because $a_{n}>A$ and $A<0$ this is equivalent to $a_{n}-A<-A$. But this would imply that $a_{n}$ is negative, giving us our contradiction.

##### Corollary 4.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ and $(b_{n})$ be sequences that converge to limits $A$ and $B$, respectfully. If $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq B$.

Consider the sequence $c_{n}=a_{n}-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B$. Because $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $a_{n}-b_{n}\leq0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B\geq0\to A\geq B$. 

##### Definition 4.19
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **bounded** if and only if $\exists B>0$ such that $\left| a_{n} \right|<B$, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, a sequence is bounded if there exists two number $B_{1},B_{2}$ such that $B_{1}<a_{n}<B_{2}$ for every sequence element $a_{n}$.

##### Definition 4.20
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **increasing** (resp. strictly increasing) if and only if $a_{n+1}>a_{n}$ ($a_{n+1}>a_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Similarly, a sequence $(b_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **decreasing** (strictly decreasing) if and only if $b_{n+1}\leq b_{n}$ ($b_{n+1}<b_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. A sequence is said to be **monotone** if and only if the sequence is increasing or is decreasing.

##### Theorem 4.21 (Monotone Convergence Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Every bounded monotone sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ converges.

We will prove that every bounded increasing sequence will converge, but the proof that every bounded decreasing sequence will converge is structured exactly the same.

Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ is bounded and increasing. Let $S=\{ a_{n}|n \in \mathbb{N} \}$, and $m=\text{ sup}(S)$ (we know that $\text{ sup}(S)$ exists because $S$ is bounded). We will use $m$ as a candidate limit for $a_{n}$. Let $\varepsilon>0$. There must exists an $x \in S$ such that $m-\varepsilon<x<m$, by the definition of a supremum. Because $x \in S$ that means $\exists l \in N|a_{l}=x$ and $m-\varepsilon<a_{l}<\varepsilon$. $a_{n}$ is increasing, so for every $n>l$, $m>a_{n}>a_{l}>m-\varepsilon$ ($a_{n}$ must be $<m$ because $m$ is the supremum). Therefore every element after $a_{l} \in N_{\varepsilon}(m)$, and thus $m$ must be the limit of the sequence.

#### 4.3 Follow Up Work

##### Exercise 4.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Develop complete proofs of all lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Lemma 4.23
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $b_{n}$ converges to a number $B\neq 0$. Then there exists a constant $\alpha>0$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ sufficiently large. (Here, we say that $b_{n}$ is eventually bounded away from zero.)

First we will show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N$, $b_{n}\in N_{B}(B)$. Let $n>N$.

If $B\geq0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{+}$ so every $b_{n}$ must be positive. If this is the case then $\left| b_{n} \right|=b_{n}$ and clearly the two must have the same limit $\left| B \right|=B$.
If $B<0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{-}$ and every $b_{n}$ must be negative. Thus $\left| b_{n} \right|=-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }-b_{n}=-B=\left| B \right|$. Thus is both cases $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$.

Using this fact let we know that $0<\left| B \right|=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|$. Let $\alpha$ be a real number such that $0<\alpha<\left| B \right|$. We can now produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N, \left| b_{n} \right|\in N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(\left| B \right|)$. Every element in $N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(B)$ is greater than $\alpha$, so we $N$ is the number we were seeking to produce and we are done.

##### Exercise 4.24*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove part $(ii)$ of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]]

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed number.

Because $B\neq0$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 23|#Lemma 4 23]] there exists an $\alpha$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ greater than some $N_{1}\in\mathbb{N}$. It then follows that $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}} \right|< \frac{1}{\alpha}$.
Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there exists an $N_{2}$ such that $\forall n >N_{2}$
$
\left| b_{n}-B \right|<\left| B\alpha \right|\cdot \varepsilon  
$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$ and suppose that $n>N$.
$
\begin{align}
&\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}  -\frac{1}{B} \right|=\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{Bb_{n}} \right| =\left| \frac{1}{Bb_{n}} \right|\left| B-b_{n} \right|    \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha} \right| \left| B-b_{n} \right|  \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha } \right| \left| B\alpha \cdot \varepsilon  \right| =\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
Therefore for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists an $N$ such that $\forall n >N$, $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right|<\varepsilon$ and thus by definition $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$. We know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$, so using part $(i)$. of the Second Algebraic Limit Theorem we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\cdot \frac{1}{b_{n}}=A/B$.

##### Theorem 4.25 (The Squeeze Theorem for Sequences)*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$, and $c_{n}$ are three sequences, and suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}$. If $a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}$ for all $n$ sufficiently large, then $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L.$

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

By the definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall  n >N_{1},\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall  n >N_{2},\left| b_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\end{align}
$
Let $n>max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$
$
\begin{align}
\left| L-a_{n} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
L-a_{n}&<\varepsilon \\
a_{n}&>L-\varepsilon \\
\left| b_{n}-L \right| &<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}-L&<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}&<\varepsilon+L
\end{align}
$
Therefore
$
\displaylines{
L-\varepsilon<a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}<\varepsilon+L\\
-\varepsilon<c_{n}-L<\varepsilon
}
$
Thus $\left| c_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$, and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L$.

##### Exercise 4.26
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Show that if $a_{n}$ converges to a limit $L$, then $a_{n}$ is bounded.

Choose a specific $\varepsilon>0$. By the definition of a limit $\exists N$ such that $\forall n>N, a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Thus every term after $a_{N}$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon+L$ and bounded below by $L-\varepsilon$. If we look at the sequence $a_{1-(N-1)}$, it is finite, so it must have an upper bound $M_{1}$ and a lower bound $B_{1}$. If we let $M=max\{ M_{1},\varepsilon+L \}$ and $B=\{ B_{1},L-\varepsilon \}$ then $M$ and $B$ will bound the whole sequence.

##### Defintion 4.27
> [!none] 
> We say that a sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is **in a set** $S$ if and only if $a_{n} \in S$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

##### Lemma 4.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ is a sequence in $S$, and suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L.$ Then $L \in S\cup S'$.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. 

Case 1: $L \in S$. We are done.

Case 2: $L\notin S$. We must show that $L \in S'$.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By the definition of a limit, $\exists N$ such that for all $n>N$ $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Suppose that every sequence element $a_{n}=L$. This would mean that the limit $L$ would equal $a_{n}$, which is an element of $S$, giving a contradiction. So there must be at least one $a_{i}$ where $i\geq n$ and $a_{i} \neq L$. Thus $a_{i}\in N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(L)$ and we have satisfied the definition of an accumulation point for $L$.

##### Lemma 4.29*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ be a set. If $x \in S'$, then there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ that satisfies $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

By the definition of an accumulation point $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ is nonempty for all $\varepsilon>0$. Notice that this set is equivalent to $N_{\varepsilon}(x)\cap S\setminus \{ x \}$. Thus for any epsilon we can produce a $y \in S\setminus \{ x \}$ in that epsilon neighborhood. Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists y_{1}|y_{1} \in N_{1}(x) \\
&\exists y_{2}|y_{2} \in N_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) \\
&\exists y_{3}|y_{3} \in N_{\frac{1}{3}}(x) \\
&\vdots\\
&\exists y_{n}|y_{n} \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x) \\
\end{align}
$
Where every $y_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (Notice that every $y_{n}$ does not have to be distinct; the function will just not be 1-1).

Now consider the sequence $a_{n}=y_{n}$. Because every $y_{n} \in S\setminus \{ x \}$, $a_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$. We now have to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. 

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|Theorem 1.3]] we can produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<\varepsilon$. Consider any $a_{m}$ such that $m>N$. $a_{m} \in N_{\frac{1}{m}}(x)\subseteq N_{\frac{1}{N}}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}$. Thus for every $m>N$ $\left| a_{m}-x \right|<\varepsilon$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

##### Corollary 4.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $p \in cl(T)$ if and only if there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $T$ such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} = p$.

First we will show the forward direction: If $p \in cl(T)$ then there exists a sequence such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$. [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] guarantees that if $p \in S'$ then we can produce such a sequence. Thus we only have to consider the case where $p \in S$, which is trivial because obviously the sequence $a_{n}=p,\forall n \in N$ converges to $p$.

[[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] Proves the backward direction.

##### Theorem 4.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

Forward direction: If $S$ is closed, then every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] if $a_{n}$ converges, it must converge to an element in $S\cup S'=cl(S)$, but because $S$ is closed $cl(S)=S$, and thus $a_{n}$ must converge to an element in $S$.

Backward direction: If every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\in S$, then $S$ is closed.

Let $x \in S'$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (and thus also in $S$), such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. By our assumption this means that $x \in S$. Thus we have proved that $S'\subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed.

##### Definition 4.32

Similarly, a sequence $c_{n}$ is said to diverge to negative infinity if and only if $\forall P<0,\exists M>0$ such that if $n\geq M$, then $c_{n}<P$.

##### Exercise 4.33

> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(\sqrt{ n })$ diverges to $\infty$.

Let $P>0$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there exists an $N$ such that $N>P^{2}\to \sqrt{ N }>P$. Thus for all $n\geq N$, $\sqrt{ n }>P$, and $\sqrt{ n }$ diverges to $\infty$.

##### Exercise 4.34*

The books skeleton is pretty much the entire proof. Refer there.

### Chapter 5

#### 5.1 Preliminary Work

##### Defintion 5.1
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **Cauchy** if and only if for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $M>0$ such that $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ for all integers $n,m\geq M$.

##### Exercise 5.2
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$ is a Cauchy sequence.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we can produce an $M>0$ such that for all $n>M$ $\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|<\varepsilon$. Let $m>M$ as well. Because $\frac{1}{m}$ is positive and less than $\frac{1}{n}$, $\left| \frac{1}{n} -\frac{1}{m}\right|<\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|<\varepsilon$. Thus $\frac{1}{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L \in \mathbb{R}$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

Let $M$ be a number such that for $\forall n>M$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, and suppose that $n$ and $m$ are both greater than $M$.

$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| &=\left| (a_{n}-L)+(L-a_{m}) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-L \right| +\left| L-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus for any $n,m>M$, $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ and so $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If a sequence is Cauchy, then it is bounded

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

There exists an $M>0$ such that for all $n,m>M$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon  
\end{align}
$
Let $n$ be fixed and set $a_{n}=A$.
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{m}-A \right| &<\varepsilon  \\
a_{m}-A&<\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&<\varepsilon+A \\
\left| A-a_{m} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
A-a_{m}&<\varepsilon \\ 
a_{m}-A&>-\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&>A-\varepsilon
\end{align}
$

Thus $A-\varepsilon$ is a lower bound and $A+\varepsilon$ is an upper bound for every element after $a_{M}$. The sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{M}$ is finite and thus must be bounded above by some number $B$ and bounded below by $-B$. Thus $min\{ A-\varepsilon,-B \}$ must be a lower bound for the whole sequence, and $max\{ A+\varepsilon,B \}$ must be an upper bound for the whole sequence.

If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is called a **subsequence** of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$. If a subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L_{1}$ then we say that $L_{1}$ is a **subsequential limit** of the original sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$.

1. $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{8}= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{7}{11}, \frac{1}{8}$
2. $(a_{2k})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{6},\dots$ This seems like it will approach 0.
3. $(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{7}{11},\dots$ This seems to be approaching $\frac{1}{2}$.

##### Lemma 5.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $m_{k}\geq k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by induction.

Base case: $k=1$. if $m_{k}$ is in the natural numbers then it must be $\geq1=k$. Thus the base case is verified.

Induction hypothesis: Assume that for some natural number $k$, $m_{k}\geq k$. We must then show that $m_{k+1}\geq k+1$. This is very straightforward to verify because $m_{k}$ is strictly increasing.

#### 5.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 5.10
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ and $l \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$ if and only if all subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$.

Forward direction: If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$, then all of the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ as well.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value. There must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$. Every $a_{m_{k}}$ where $m_{k}>N$ must be within this epsilon range as well, making it convergent.

Backward direction: If all the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must as well.
This proof is trivial, because $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a subsequence of itself.

##### Theorem 5.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence and let $b_{k}:=a_{2k}$ and $c_{k}:=a_{2k+1}$. Show that $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L$ if and only if both $(b_{k})$ and $(c_{k})$ converges to $L$.

This is just applying the theorem above?

##### Lemma 5.12 (Monotone Subsequence Lemma)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a monotone subsequence.

Let $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. We will call a term $a_{M}$ a **dominant term** if and only if $a_{M}>a_{n}$ for all $n>M$.

There must either be a finite amount of dominant terms for $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or an or an infinite amount.

If there is an infinite number of dominant terms, then the subsequence $\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ of dominant terms will be decreasing by definition of a dominant term.

If there is a finite amount of dominant terms there must exists a greatest dominant term (greatest not in value, but in its placement in the sequence), $a_{N}$. Thus for all $n>N$, $a_{n}$ cannot be a dominant term. By negating the definition of a dominant term, we get the following fact:

> [!none] 
> For every $n>N$  there must exists an $m>n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_{m}\geq a_{n}$.

Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists m_{1}>N+1:a_{m_{1}}\geq a_{N+1}\\
&\exists m_{2}>m_{1}:a_{m_{2}}\geq a_{m_{1}}\\
&\exists m_{3}>m_{1}:a_{m_{3}}\geq a_{m_{2}}\\
&\vdots\\
&\exists m_{k}>m_{k-1}:a_{m_{k}}\geq a_{m_{k-1}}\\
\end{align}
$
Thus if we set $\{ a_{n_{k}} \}=\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ by construction the sequence will be increasing and thus monotone.

In both the case where there are a finite number of dominant terms, and in the case where there is an infinite number, we can produce a monotone sequence.

##### Theorem 5.13 (Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence.

Combining the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem|#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem]] with [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma|#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma]] gives us the desired result.

##### Lemma 5.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})$ has a convergent subsequence, then $a_{n}$ must converge.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value and $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a convergent subsequence within $(a_{n})$.
$
\exists N_{1}|\forall k>N_{1}  \left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$
$
\exists N_{2}\forall n,m>N\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$

Let $k>N_{1}$ and $n,m>N_{2}$.
$
\left| a_{n}-L \right| \leq \left| a_{n}-a_{m_{k}} \right| +\left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon.
$

##### Theorem 5.15 (Cauchy Criterion)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

1. Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. (Easy to prove the same way we did for convergent sequences in [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 4 26|#Exercise 4 26]]).
2. Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences]])
3. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence.
4. Every Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges ([[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 14|#Lemma 5 14]]).
5. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

### Chapter 1

#### 1.1 Preliminary Work
##### Axiom 1.1
> [!none] 
> $\mathbb{R}$ is an [[Ordered field|Ordered field]].

##### Axiom 1.2 (The Archimedean Principle)
> [!none] 
> For every number $b\in \mathbb{R}$, there is some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ that is larger than $b$.

##### Theorem 1.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  For any positive number $\epsilon$, there exists a number $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than $\epsilon$.

Pick a $\delta>0$ such that $\frac{1}{\delta}=\epsilon$. The AP gives that for some number $n\in \mathbb{N}$
$
\begin{align}
n&>\delta \\
\frac{1}{n}&< \frac{1}{\delta} = \epsilon
\end{align}
$

##### Axiom 1.4 (The Well Ordering Principle for $\mathbb{N}$)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ as a least element

##### Theorem 1.5 (The Principle of Mathematical Induction)
> [!none] 
> - [x] 
> Consider a statement $P(N)$ that is defined for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that 
> 1. $P(1)$ is true, and
> 2. for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, if $P(n)$ is true then $P(n+1)$ is true.
> 
> Then $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose the hypotheses are true, but the conclusion is false.

Consider the set $S:=\{ n\in\mathbb{N}|P(n) \text{ is false} \}$. By our initial assumption this set cannot be empty. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well-Ordering Principle for mathbb N|Well-Ordering Principle]] this set has a least element $l$. $P(l-1)$ must be true, otherwise $l-1$ would be in the set, and $l$ would not be the least element. But if $l-1$ is true, then by our first assumption, $P(l-1+1)=P(l)$ must be true. Therefore $P(l)$ is must true, and false (because it is in $S$), giving us our contradiction.

##### Definition 1.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $A$ and $B$ are nonempty sets. Then $A$ is said to be **equinumerous** with $B$ iff there exists a bijection $f:A\to B$. In this case we write $A \sim B$ and say that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality.

##### Definition 1.7
> [!none]
> A set $S$ is said to be **finite** if and only if $S=\emptyset$ or $S \sim \{ 1,\dots ,n\}$, we say that $S$ is **finite with** $n$ **elements** and write $\left| S \right|=n$, where $\left| S \right|$ is referred to as the number of elements in the finite set $S$.

##### Exercise 1.8
> [!none] 
> - [x] Explicity show that the set $\{ North, East, South, West \}$ and the set $\{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ are equinumerous in the sense of [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 7|Definition 1.7]] (i.e., by constructing a bijection between the two sets). Do these sets satisfy definition 1.7 for some $n$?

Consider the function $f:\{ North, East, South, West \} \to \{ 1,4,7,10 \}$ s.t.
$
\begin{align}
f(North) &= 1 \\
f(East) &= 4 \\

It is trivial to show that $f$ is a 1-1 and onto, and that both sets are equinumerous to the set $\{ 1,2,3,4 \}$.

##### Theorem 1.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let  $S$ be a set with $n$ elements in it. Then $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements in it.

If $S$ has one element in it $P(S)=S$, both of which have 1 element in them. When you add an element to any set, the new power set will be the old power set, plus every set in the old power set plus the new element. Thus every time we add a new element we double the elements in the power set. It is easy to show that these two facts, when combined, imply that $P(S)$ has $2^{n}$ elements when $S$ has $n$ elements.

Alternatively, to construct any set we could iterate through every element of the set and either put it in the set, or not. This results in $2^{n}$ different ways we could construct the sets.

##### Exercise 1.13
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Show that $2\mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{N}$ by identifying a bijection between them.

Consider the function $f:2\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(e) = \frac{e}{2}
\end{align}
$
for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ $f(2n)$ will map to $n$, ensuring that the function is onto. If $f(m)=f(n)$ then $2n=2m$, which implies $n=m$, showing that the function is also 1-1, and thus a bijection.

##### Theorem 1.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The sets $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality (or, put another way: $\mathbb{Z}$ is countably infinite).

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(n)&=\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)\qquad n \text{ is even} \\
f(n)&=-\frac{n-1}{2}\qquad n \text{ is odd}
\end{align}
$
For any positive integer $x$, $f(2x)$ will map to it ($2x$ is guaranteed to be a natural number). For any negative (or = 0) integer $y$, $f(-2y +1)$ will map to $y$. Therefore $f$ is onto.

Suppose $f(m)=f(n)$. WLG, if $m$ is odd, and $n$ is even, then we have:
$
\begin{align}
\frac{n}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
n&= -m+1 \\
n+m&= 1
\end{align}
$
But if both $n$ and $m$ are natural numbers their sum must be greater than $1$. Therefore one cannot be even and the other odd.

It's trivial to show the following equations are only true when $n=m$.
$
\begin{align}
-\frac{n-1}{2}&=-\frac{m-1}{2} \\
\frac{n}{2}&=\frac{m}{2}
\end{align}
$
Thus $f$ is 1-1 as well, making it a bijection.

#### 1.2 Main Theorems

##### Composition of Two Bijections Lemma
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to C$ are bijections, then the composite function $f \circ g:A\to C$ will be a bijection as well.

This is a fact will be useful in multiple of the following proofs.

First we will prove that for bijections $f:X\to S$ and $g:S\to V$, $g\circ f:X \to V$ is a bijection as well. 

For every element $v\in V$ there exists an element in $x \in X$ such that maps to it (by the definition of $f$ being onto). For every $x$ there is an element $s \in S$ which maps to it, because $g$ is onto. Thus there exists an $s \in S$ that will map to any $v \in V$, so $g \circ f$ in onto.

Next, we must show that $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well.

If $g(f(n))=g(f(m))$ then because $g$ is 1-1, $f(n)=f(m)$. Because $f$ is 1-1 as well that implies $n=m$, so $g \circ f$ is 1-1 as well as onto.



##### Theorem 1.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is countable

If $S\in\mathbb{N}$ is finite, then it is countable by definition.

The meat of the proof lies in proving that $S$ is countable when it is infinite. 

Consider the function $f:\mathbb{N}\to S$ such that
$
\begin{align}
f(1) &= min(S) \\
f(2) &= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1) \}) \\
\vdots \\
f(n)&=min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(n-1) \})
\end{align}
$

We know that such minimum elements must exist because of the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|well ordering principle]]. Our job is now to show that this function is both 1-1 and onto.

Consider the the following set where $x \in S$
$
S_{x}:=\{ y \in S|y\leq x \} 
$

Because this set is bounded below (Well Ordering Principle), and above (by x), it is finite, and thus has a cardinality.

For any $x \in S$ consider $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)$. The cardinality of $S_{x}$ is 1+ the number of elements less than $x$ in $S$ (the +1 is because $x$ is included in the set as well). Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|) = min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots f(\left| S_{x}-1 \right|) \})$ take the least element of the set $S$ with all the elements less than $x$ removed. Thus $f(\left| S_{x} \right|)=x$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $x \in S$, $f$ is onto.

We will argue that $f$ is 1-1 by contradiction. If $f$ were not 1-1, then there exists an $n$ and $m$ such that $f(n)=f(m)$ and $n\neq m$. That implies that WLOG, $n<m$. $f(m)= min(S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \})$. Because $n<m$ $f(n)$ must not be in the set $S\text{ \\ }\{ f(1),f(2),\dots,f(m-1) \}$. $f(m)$ must in in this set, because it is the least element of it. But $f(m)=f(n)$, so $f(n)$ is in this set. Thus we have our contradiction, showing that $f$ is 1-1.

Therefore, $f$ is 1-1 and onto, making it a bijection, and making the set $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every subset of a countable set is countable.

Suppose $X\subseteq S$ where $S$ is a countable set.
If a set $S$ is countable, then there exists a bijection $f$ from $\mathbb{N}\to S$. Consider the sets $\mathbb{N}':=\{ n \in \mathbb{N}|f(n) \in X \}$. If we use the same function $f$, but change the domain and codomain such that it goes from $\mathbb{N}'\to S$, it is not difficult to see that it is a bijection.

By construction the function is onto, and we already know that it is 1-1. Therefore there $f$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}'$ to $X$. But $\mathbb{N}'$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|Theorem 1.15]] $X$ must be countable as well.

##### Theorem 1.17
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $F$ is a collection of nonempty sets, then the equinumerous relation $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation on $F$.

To show that $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation we must show that it is reflexive ($A\sim A$), symmetric (if$A\sim B$, then $B\sim A$), and transitive (if $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$, then $A\sim C$).

1. Reflexive—If we consider the function $f:A\to A$ for all $a\in A$ such that $f(a)= a$, checking that it is onto and 1-1 is trivial.
2. Symmetry—If $A\sim B$ then there exists a bijection $f$ from $A\to B$ for all $a\in A$, and $b\in B$. The inverse of a bijection is still a bijection, it is easy to verify that $f^{-1}$ is a bijection from $B\to A$. Thus implying that $B\sim A$.
3. Transitive—If $A\sim B$ and $B\sim C$ then there exists bijections $f$ and $g$ from $A\to B$ and from $B\to C$ respectively. Once again, it is straightforward to verify that the function $f \circ g$ is a bijection from $A \to C$, implying that $A \sim C$.

##### Theorem 1.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. If there exists an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:\mathbb{N} \to T$, then $T$ is countable.

Thus we have a bijection from $S$ to $f(S)$, which is a subset of of $N$. Thus 
First, we will consider the case where there is an injection $f:S\to \mathbb{N}$. $f$ is already 1-1, and if we change the codomain to $f(S)$, then by definition it is onto as well. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 15|#Theorem 1 15]] because $f(S) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, $f(S)$ is countable. If $f(S)$ is finite it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite as well, and thus countable. If $f(S)$ is not countable then there is a bijection from $f(s)\to \mathbb{N}$.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because we have bijections from $S\to f(S)$ and from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$, there also exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, making $S$ countable.

Now we consider the case where there is a surjection $g:\mathbb{N}\to T$. Consider the class of sets $X_{t}:=\{ n \in\mathbb{N}|g(n)=t \}$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] $X_{t}$ will always have a least element. Thus we construct the set $N:=\{t\in T|min({ X_{t} })\}$. 

If we consider the same $g$, but tweak the domain to $N$ instead of $\mathbb{N}$, it will now be 1-1, because the least element of a set is unique. Thus it is both 1-1 and onto, giving a bijection from $N\to T$. Because $N \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ there is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to N$. By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] because there are bijections from $\mathbb{N} \to N$ and from $N\to T$ there must also be a bijection from $N\to T$, making $T$ countable.

##### Corollary 1.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ and $T$ be sets with $T$ countable. If there exists an injection $f:S\to T$ then $S$ is countable. Similarly, if there exists a surjection $g:T\to S$, then $S$ is countable.

Consider the function $\hat{f}:S\to f(S)$ where the only difference between $f$ and $\hat{f}$ is their codomain. $\hat{f}$ is a bijection, and because $f(S)\subseteq T$, it must be countable ([[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]]). If $f(S)$ is finite, then it is trivial to show that $S$ is finite (and thus countable) as well. If $f(S)$ is not finite, then there exists a bijection between $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. Thus there is a bijection from $S\to f(S)$ as well as from $f(S)\to \mathbb{N}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $S\to \mathbb{N}$, thus making $S$ countable.

Consider the set $X_{s}:=\{t\in T|g(t)=s\}$. Now we construct the set $T':=\{min(X_{s})|s \in S\}$. Because the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] guarantees that there is only one least element, the function $\hat{g}:T'\to S$ is 1-1 as well as onto, making it a bijection. $T'\subseteq T$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 16|#Corollary 1 16]] $T'$ is countable. We now have a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to T'$ and from $T'\to S$. Thus by the [[Mathematical Analysis#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma|#Composition of Two Bijections Lemma]] there exists a bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, making $S$ countable.

##### Lemma 1.20
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then so are $A\cup  B$ and $A \times B$.

First we will prove that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $A$ and $B$ are countable there exists bijection $f$ and $g$ such that any element in $A$ or $B$ can be represented as
$
\displaylines{
a_{n}=f(n)\\
b_{n}=g(n)
}
$
Let's create a new function $h:\mathbb{N}\to A\cup B$
$
\begin{align}
h(n)&=a_{\frac{n}{2}}\qquad \text{n is even} \\
h(n)&=b_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\qquad \text{ n is odd}
\end{align}
$
By theorem [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 18|#Theorem 1 18]] we only must show that $h$ is onto in order to show that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Because $f$ and $g$ are countable we know any element in set $A$ can be represented as $a_{n}$ and any element in set $B$ can be represented as $b_{n}$. Thus any element of $A\cup B$ can be represented as either $a_{n}$ or $b_{n}$.

For an arbitrary $b_{n}$, $h(2n-1)$ will map to $b_{n}$. For an arbitrary $a_{n}$, $h(2n)$ will map to $a_{n}$. Thus the function is onto and we have proved that $A\cup B$ is countable.

Next we must prove that $A\times B$ is countable as well. We will again use the countability of $A$ and $B$ to represent an arbitrary element of them as $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ respectively.

I don't want to write out the whole rest of the proof, but the following picture should give a good idea that there is a bijection from $N\to A\cup B$.

Where $f(1)$ would be the first element hit by the purple arrow, $f(2)$ the second, and so on.

##### Theorem 1.21
> [!none] 
> - [>]  $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

To prove this we will invoke [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 1 20|#Lemma 1 20]] to say that $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$ is countable. Consider the function $f:\mathbb{Q}\to \mathbb{N}^{2}$
$
f(q)=(a,b)\qquad \text{ Where a/b=q and is in lowest form}
$

If we show this function to be injective, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 1 19|#Corollary 1 19]] $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.

Suppose there exists an two rational numbers such that where $q_{1}=\frac{a}{b}\neq \frac{x}{y}=q_{2}$, but $(a,b)=(x,y)$. The second statement, by definition, means that $a=x$ and $b=y$. but if that is true, then $\frac{a}{b}=\frac{x}{y}$ thus we have contradiction, meaning $f$ must be injective, and $\mathbb{Q}$ must be countable.

##### Theorem 1.22
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable

This proof is really beefy and I don't want to write it down. The skeleton in the book is very thorough and filling in the gaps should not be difficult.

##### Definition 1.23
> [!none] 
> A set $S$ is said to be **uncountable** if and only if it is fails to satisfy [[Mathematical Analysis#Definition 1 12|#Definition 1 12]]

In other words, for some set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ there is no bijection from $\mathbb{N}\to S$, and the set is not finite.

##### Definition 1.24
> [!none] 
> If $p$ is an upper bound for a set $S$ and $p \in S$ then we say $p$ is a maximum element of $S$ (denoted $p=max(S)$). The definition for a minimum element is constructed similarly.

##### Definition 1.26
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded above. A number $\alpha$ is a least upper bound for $S$ if and only if
> 1. $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $S$ and
> 2. if $y<\alpha$, then there exists some $x \in S$ such that $y<x\leq \alpha$.

Alternatively, for some number $\alpha$ to be the least upper bound for a set, then it must be both greater than or equal to every element in the set, and less than or equal to every other upper bound for $S$.

##### Exercise 1.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=\left\{  0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \dots \right\}$. Is $10$ an upper bound of $S$? Is $2$ an upper bound? What is the least upper bound for $S$? Does $S$ have a maximum element?

For all $n \in N$
$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n}&>0\\
-\frac{1}{n}&<0 \\
1-\frac{1}{n}&<1<10
\end{align}
$
Therefore $10$ is an upper bound for $S$. By the same argument $2$ is as well.

In the last step we showed that $1-\frac{1}{n}<1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $1$ is an upper bound for $S$. Consider any number $y<1$. by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\exists m \in \mathbb{N}| \frac{1}{m}<1-y$. Thus from rearranging that inequality we get
$
y<1-\frac{1}{m}
$
Because $m$ is a natural number, the term on the right will be an element of the set. Thus we have shown that for any $y<1$ there exists a number $>y$ and less than $1$ in $S$. Thus by the definition of a supremum $1$ is the least upper bound of $S$.

##### Lemma 1.28
> [!none] 
> If a nonempty set in $S$ has a least upper bound, then that least upper bound is unique. In other words, $S$ cannot have two different least upper bounds.

Suppose we have two numbers $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ that are least upper bounds for a set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We will argue that they must be the same number by contradiction. If they were not, then WLOG $x<y$. But $x$ is an upper bound, so $y$ cannot be the least upper bound if $x$ is less than it. Thus we have our contradiction and every least upper bound is unique.

##### Definition 1.29
> [!none] 
> Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded below. A number $\beta$ is the **greatest lower bound** for $S$ (denoted $\beta =inf(S)$) if and only if
> 1. $\beta$ is a lower bound for $S$
> 2. if $z>\beta$, then there exists some $x \in S$ such that $\beta\leq x<z$. 

##### Axiom 1.30 (The Axiom of Completeness)
> [!none] 
> Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound in $\mathbb{R}$. Equivalently: Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded below has a greatest lower bound in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 1.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Why are the two statements of the Axiom of Completeness equivalent?

For some some $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ bounded blow, consider the set $B:=\{b \in \mathbb{R}|\forall x \in S, b\leq x\}$. This set is bounded above by every element of $S$, so the Axiom of Completeness says $m=\text{ sup}(B)$ must exists. Because every element in $S$ is an upper bound for $B$, $m\leq S$. Because $B$ is the set of upper bounds for $S$, by definition of a least upper bound, $m>$ every bound for $S$. Thus is satisfies both the criteria to be greatest lower bound for $S$.

The exact same process can be carried out to show that if we assume a set bounded below has a greatest lower bound, then any set must have a greatest upper bound. Thus the two formulations of the Axiom of Completeness are the same.

1. $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable,
2. $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, and
3. The union of two countable sets is countable as well.

We will prove that $\mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$ is not countable by contradiction. Assume that it is countable. Now consider the set $\mathbb{Q}\cup \mathbb{R}\text{ \\ }\mathbb{Q}$. Because both of these sets are countable, their union must be as well. But we know what their union is; by definition it must be $\mathbb{R}$, which is uncountable. Thus we have our contradiction and the irrationals must be uncountable.

4. Yes it is. For any natural number $n$, $0=0$ and $\frac{1}{n+1}< \frac{1}{n}$

##### Theorem 1.39 (The Nested Interval Property)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $\{ I_{n} \}$ is a collection of nested, nonempty intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{R}$. Then the collection $\{ I_{n} \}$ has a nonempty intersection—in other words, there exists $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p$ is an element of $I_{n}$, for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$.

Consider the set $A:=\{n \in \mathbb{N}| a_{n} \}$. We know that $b_{1}$ is an upper bound on this set, because for any $a_{n}$, $b_{n}$ is greater than it, and $b_{1}<b_{n}$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}>1$. Thus we can invoke the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness|#Axiom 1 30 The Axiom of Completeness]] and say that $a=\text{ sup}(A)$ exists.

By the definition of a supremum, $a\geq a_{n}$ $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$a$ must also be less than or equal to every $b_{n}$. To show this fact we must first prove that any $b_{k}$ is greater than $a_{i}$ $\forall i \in \mathbb{N}$. If this were not the case, and there were some $a_{i}$ such that $a_{i}>b_{k}$, then there must also be an $b_{i}$ such that $b_{i}>a_{i}$. But this would mean that all elements in the $i$th interval are greater than all elements in the $k$th interval, so neither could be a subset of the other. Thus every $b_{n}$ must be greater than every $a_{i}$. Using this fact, if $a>b_{k}$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, then there would be another upper bound, $b_{k}$, which is less than $a$, contradicting the definition of a supremum.

Therefore
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n}\qquad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
$
By construction thus must mean that $a$ is in every interval $I_{n}$.

##### Exercise 1.40
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Note that the hypothesis in the statement of the Nested Interval Property includes the assumption that each interval looks like $[a_{n},b_{n}]$. Would the theorem be hold for other types of nonempty intervals?

Nothing would change in our argument until the last line. 
$
a_{n}\leq a\leq b_{n} \qquad \forall  n \in \mathbb{N}
$

But this only implies that $a$ must be in the set $[a_{n}, b_{n}]$ *because the endpoints are included*. If instead it was in the form $(a_{n},b_{n}]$, or $(a_{n},b_{n})$, then we could have $a=a_{n}$, which would satisfy the inequality above, but not be included in those sets.

Consider the intervals $I_{n}=$ $\left( 0, \frac{1}{n} \right]$. For any number there will always be a $\frac{1}{n}$ smaller than it ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]]), so there will be a set it is not included in. This is only possible because the supremum of the left endpoints = 0, and because they are open intervals $0$ is not included in any of them.

> Show that $J_{1}\subseteq J_{2}\subseteq J_{3}\dots$ Now define $I_{n}=J_{n}\cap \mathbb{Q}$. In a world consisting of only rational numbers, $\{ I_{n} \}$ constitutes a collection of nonempty, nested intervals of the form $[a_{n},b_{n}]$ contained in $\mathbb{Q}$. Does it follow that there is some number $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p$ is an element in **every** $I_{n}$?

For any natural number $n$, $\frac{1}{10^{n}}>0$, so $a_{n}<b_{n}$. $a_{n+1}$ must be greater than $a_{n}$ (or, if the next decimal is 0, equal to $a_{n}$), because it is just $a_{n}$ plus the next decimal. $b_{n+1}=a_{n+1}+\frac{1}{10^{n+1}}<a_{n}+\frac{1}{10^{n}}=b_{n}$. Therefore each successive interval must be a subset of the last.

No, it does not imply that there will be a rational number $p$ that is in the intersection of every one of these sets. The Nested Interval Property only implies that there will be a **real number** such that it is in the intersection of all of the sets.

##### Exercise 1.50*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number.

We must show that for any $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ where $a<b$ there exists a rational number $q$ such that $a<q<b$.

First, consider the case where $0\leq a<b$.

From [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we know that there exists a $n \in \mathbb{N}|$ $0<\frac{1}{n} < \left| b-a \right|$. Let $q=\frac{1}{n}$, where $q$ is clearly rational.

Consider the set $S=\{n \in \mathbb{N}|b\leq n\cdot q\}$. Because $S\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N|#Axiom 1 4 The Well Ordering Principle for mathbb N]] allows us to produce an $m =min(S)$. $m-1$ must not be in $S$, otherwise $m$ would not be the least element of $S$ (we are guaranteed that it is in the naturals because $q<b$, so 1 cannot be the least element, thus $m-1\geq1$). By the construction of $S$ this implies that $(m-1)\cdot q <b$. 

$m$ must be in $S$, by the definition of a least element. This implies $mq\geq  b$.
$
\begin{align}
mq&\geq b \\
mq-q&\geq b-q>b-(b-a) \qquad \text{because }q<b-a\\ 
(m-1)q&>a
\end{align}
$
Therefore we have $a<(m-1)q<b$. Because $q$ is rational and $m-1$ is a natural number, $(m-1)q$ must be rational as well, and we have thus proved for any $0\leq a<b$ there is a rational number in between $a$ and $b$.

The case where $a<0<b$ is trivial because by construction $0$ a rational number within the interval.

Lastly we consider the case where $a<b\leq0$. Consider the interval between $-b$ and $-a$. Because $a,b$ are negative, $-a,-b$ must be positive and so we can use our previous work to produce a number $q \in Q|-b<q<-a$. negating this inequality produces $a<-q<b$, which is the desired result.

Thus for any $a$ and $b$ there will always be a rational number in between them.

##### Exercise 1.51*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $a<b$, then the open interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many rational numbers.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] each of them will produce a unique rational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of rationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Corollary 1.52*
> [!none] 
> - [x] Between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one irrational number.

We will prove this statement by contradiction. Assume it is false, and there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that in between them there are **no** irrational numbers. 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 50|#Exercise 1 50]] there exists a $b \in \mathbb{Q}|a<q<b$. Consider an arbitrary $x \in (a-q,b-q)$.
$
\begin{align}
a-q&<x<b-q \\
a&<x+q<b
\end{align}
$
Therefore $x+q \in (a,b)$ and by our initial assumption $x+q$ is rational. But $q$ is rational, so $(x+q)-q=x$ must be rational as well. Thus all elements in the set $(a-q,b-q)$ are rational. From now on let $a'=a-q$ and $b'=b-q$.

Now consider the interval $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$, for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $s \in (n\cdot a', n\cdot b')$
$
\begin{align}
n\cdot a' < s < n\cdot b' \\
a'< \frac{s}{n}<b'
\end{align}
$
Therefore $\frac{s}{n} \in (a',b')$ and is rational. But if $\frac{s}{n}$ is rational, then $\frac{s}{n} \cdot n=s$ must be rational as well. Thus any element of an interval of the form $(n\cdot a',n\cdot b')$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ will be rational.

Here we will take a moment to remember that
$
\begin{align}
a&<q<b \\
a'=a-q&<0<b-q=b'
\end{align}
$
$n$ is any arbitrary natural number, so as we increase $n$ it will have the effect of scaling up this interval to any desired size while keeping all its members rational. This allows us to show that irrational numbers don't exist, which is obviously false. But for the sake of precision let us take a specific natural number for our contradiction.

By the [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there will be an $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m> \frac{3}{b'}$. Therefore $b' \cdot m >3$. $m\cdot b'>3>\sqrt{ 3 }$, and $\sqrt{ 3 }>0>a'\cdot m$. This implies that $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is in the interval $(m\cdot a',m\cdot b')$, making it rational. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 32|#Theorem 1 32]] $\sqrt{ 3 }$ is irrational, giving us our contradiction and completing the proof.

##### Exercise 1.53*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  if $a<b$, then the interval $(a,b)$ contains infinitely many irrational number.

For any arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$ consider the set of subintervals $\left\{  \left( a,a+\frac{\left| b-a \right|}{n} \right),\left( a+\frac{\left | b-a \right|}{n}, a+\frac{2\left| b-a \right|}{n}\right) ,\dots,\left( a+\frac{(n-1)\left| b-a \right|}{n},b \right)   \right\}$

Because there are $n$ disjoint sets, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 1 52|#Exercise 1 52]] each of them will produce a unique irrational number. Because we chose an arbitrary $n \in N$ the number of irrationals in the interval will surpass any finite number.

##### Exercise 1.54 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove that if $z$ is an upper bound for $A$, and $z \in A$, then it must be true that $z=sup(A)$.

- Because $z$ is already established as an upper bound, the only thing which we have to show is that $z\leq b$, where $b$ is any other upper bound.
- We will prove by contradiction
- Assume there is an upper bound $b<z$ outside of the set. But since $z$ is in the set it is not an upper bound. Therefore we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.55*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Archimedean Principle was presented as an axiom. Show that, in fact, the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

Arch: For any b in the Real Numbers there exists a natural number $n > b$.

Axiom: For any nonempty subset of R which is bounded above there exists a least upper bound.

We will prove this by contradiction. Our initial assumption is that the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle, which is logically equivalent to the Archimedean Principle being true and the Axiom of Completeness being false.

Let us assume that the Axiom of Completeness is true and that the Archimedean Principle is not true.

That the Archimedean Principle is not true implies that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, $n \ngtr b$. Then $b$ would be an upper bound for $\mathbb{N}$. By the Axiom of Completeness, $\mathbb{N}$ must have a least upper bound as it is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and it is bounded above.

Let us call this least upper bound $m$. If $m$ is a least upper bound, then $m - 1$ cannot be a bound to $\mathbb{N}$. Since $m - 1$ is not an upper bound, that implies that $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} | n > m - 1$. This in turn implies that $m < n + 1$. However, because the $\mathbb{N}$ are closed under addition, $n + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and because $m$ is now shown to be less than a natural number, it cannot be the least upper bound. This is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be false. That the Axiom of Completeness does not imply the Archimedean Principle is untrue. We have therefore proven that the Axiom of Completeness implies the Archimedean Principle.

##### Exercise 1.56*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The Axiom of Completeness stipulates, in a very specific way, that the set of real number, $\mathbb{R}$, completes the set of rational numbers, $\mathbb{Q}$. To appreciate this, suppose that you are working in a number universe consisting of only rational numbers. Show that there does exist a nonempty set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $S$ has a rational upper bound and yet $S$ has no rational least upper bound.

Consider the set $S = \{x \in \mathbb{Q} | x \cdot x < 2\}$.

Let us find the least upper bound $s$ of the set $S$. We propose $\sqrt{2}$ as $s$, and will show that both $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ and that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

First let us demonstrate that $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$ with a proof by contradiction. Suppose $\exists x \in S | x > \sqrt{2}$. Then $x^{2} > 2$, and by the definition of $S$, $S$ cannot contain $x$. Thus, our initial assumption must be false, and $\forall x \in S$, $x \leq s$.

Second let us demonstrate that $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$, also with a proof by contradiction. Let us then suppose that $\exists b \in \mathbb{R} | b < s$. Then by the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ proved in exercise 1.5, we know that $\exists n \in \mathbb{Q} | b < n < s$. From this we know that $n^{2} < s^{2}$, or that $n^{2} < 2$. Since $n \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $n^{2} < 2$, by definition of $S$, $n \in S$. Because $n \in S$ and $n > b$, $b$ cannot be an upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; therefore $\forall$ upper bounds $b$ of $S$, $b \geq s$.

Therefore, $s = \sqrt{2}$ is the least upper bound of $S$. It should be clear that $S$ has no end of rational upper bounds; however $S$ has a irrational least upper bound.

##### Exercise 1.57*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose that $p$ is a prime number. Show that there is no rational number $z$ that satifies $z^{2}=p$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose there is a $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\frac{a}{b} = z$ and $z^{2}=p$, and $\frac{a}{b}$ is in lowest form.
$
\begin{align}
\left( \frac{a}{b} \right)^{2} &= p \\
a^{2} &= pb^{2}
\end{align}
$
From this statement we can see that $p$ is a factor of $a$. If it were not then $a^{2}$ would not have it as a factor either, which it clearly does. Thus we can write $a = px$, where $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.
$
\begin{align}
(px)^{2} &= pb^{2} \\
px^{2} &= b^{2}
\end{align}
$
By the same argument we can see that $p$ is also a factor of $b$. But if $p$ is a factor of both $b$ and $a$, then $\frac{a}{b}$ is not in lowest form, and we have contradiction.

##### Exercise 1.58*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $p$ is a positive number. Use the Axiom of Completeness to show that there is a number $z \in\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies $z^{2}=p$.

Let $s$ be the least upper bound of the set $S=\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^{2} < p\}$.

Let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$. We begin by assuming that $s^{2} < p$.

Consider $(s + \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s + \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon < 1$, $\epsilon^{2} < \epsilon$, and since $p > s$:

$
\begin{gather*}
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon \\
	s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon < s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1)
\end{gather*}
$

Let us now choose an $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2}$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	\epsilon (p + 1) < p - s^{2} \\
	s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p
\end{gather*}
$

From our initial comparison $s^{2} + s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} < s^{2} + p \epsilon + \epsilon$ and $s^{2} + \epsilon (p + 1) < p$ we may conclude that $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$.

Since $(s + \epsilon)^{2} < p$, $(s + \epsilon) \in S$ and $(s + \epsilon) > s$. Therefore, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$ and we have run into a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong and $s^{2} \nless p$.

Now let us prove by contradiction that $s^{2} \ngtr p$. Let us then initially assume that $s^{2} > p$.

Consider $(s - \epsilon)^{2}$ where $0 < \epsilon < 1$.

$
\begin{gather*}
	(s - \epsilon)^{2} \\
	s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2}
\end{gather*}
$

Since $0 < \epsilon$, $s^{2} - s \epsilon + \epsilon^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon$. Let us then choose an $\epsilon$ such that $s \epsilon < s^{2} - p$. Then $s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > s^{2} - s \epsilon > p$, $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$. Since $(s - \epsilon)^{2} > p$, $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ by the definition of $S$. Since $s - \epsilon$ is an upper bound for $S$ and it is smaller than $s$, $s$ cannot be the least upper bound of $S$. Here is our contradiction; our initial assumption must be incorrect and $s^{2} \ngtr p$.

Since we have shown through contradiction that $s^{2} \nless p$ and $s^{2} \ngtr p$, $s^{2}$ must equal $p$. Thus $s$ is a real number which satisfies $s^{2} = p$.

##### Exercise 1.59 
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $S$ is a bounded nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Define the related set $T =\{ -x|x \in S \}$. Prove that $T$ is bounded and that $\text{sup}(T)=-\text{inf}(S)$ and $\text{inf}(T)=-\text{sup}(S).$

- Show that $-\text{inf(S)}$ is an upper bound for T
- Show that the negative of the set of all the lower bounds of T is the same as the set of all of the upper bounds for t. 
- Show that the negative of every lower bound  is an upper bound.
- Since inf(T) is greater than every lower bound the negative of both with mean -inf(T) is less than every upper bound.
- Thus it is both greater than every element in the set, and it is less than every bound, making it = sup(T).

Let $\epsilon = min\left\{  \frac{\left| c-a \right|}{2}, \frac{\left| b-c \right|}{2}  \right\}$. 
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $a$:
$
c-\frac{c-a}{2}=\frac{c}{2} + \frac{a}{2}> \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}>a \\
$
Consider the case where $c$ is closer to $b$:
$
c+ \frac{b-c}{2}=\frac{b}{2}+\frac{c}{2}< \frac{b}{2}+\frac{b}{2}=b
$
From these cases it is clear that $\forall x \in N_{\epsilon}$ will be inside $S$. This is not true for the interval $S=(a,b]$ because $b+\epsilon>b$ for any value of $\epsilon>0$.

It means that there exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that there are no points in the set within that $\epsilon$ radius of $p$.

For example, take $\epsilon=0.1$. There are no integers in the sets $(1.9,2.1)\text{ \\ }\{ 2 \}$ or the set $(\pi-0.1,\pi+0.1)\text{ \\ }\{ \pi \}$. Thus they are no accumulation points of $\mathbb{Z}$.

Proof by contradiction: If this were false there would be an element $x \in S'$ and $x \cancel{ \in } S$ and $S$ would have to be closed. This would mean that $x \in S\cup S'$, but we have already established that $x$ is not in $S$, therefore $S\neq S\cup S'$, meaning it is not closed, and we have a contradiction.

##### Theorem 2.15
> [!none]
> - [>]  Let $A,B\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $(A\cup B)'$, then $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$.

We will prove by contraposition. The above statement is logically equivalent to: if $x \notin A'$ and $x \notin B'$, then $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

By the definition of $x$ not being in $A'$, there exists a $\epsilon$ such that $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap A$ is an empty set. Likewise there must exists a $\delta$ such that $N_{\delta }^{*}(x)\cap B$ is empty as well. WLOG $\delta<\epsilon$. Because $N_{\delta}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\epsilon  }^{*}(x)$ there are no points from $A$ *or* $B$ that are in the deleted delta-neighborhood of $x$. This is is essentially the definition of what it means for $x \notin (A\cup B)'$.

##### Corollary 2.16

Let $A$ and $B$ both be closed sets. For any $x \in (A\cup B)'$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 15|#Theorem 2 15]] $x \in A'$ or $x \in B'$. But because $A$ and $B$ are closed $A'\subseteq A$ and $B'\subseteq B$, and thus $A',B' \subseteq A\cup B$, and $x \in A\cup B$. This shows that $(A\cup B)'\subseteq A\cup B$, which by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] makes $A\cup B$ closed.

##### Lemma 2.16.1

From the hypothesis of the statement, we know there exists an element $x \in (a,b)$ and $x \in S'$. Because $x \in S'$ there must then exists $y \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ for all $\epsilon>0$. Let $c=min(\{ \left| b-x \right|,\left| x-a \right| \})$. Consider an $\epsilon|\epsilon<c$. $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)=(x-c,x+c)$. By the construction of $c$, $x-c\geq a$ and $x+c\leq b$. This implies that $y$ must be in $(a,b)$. Thus we have produced an element $y \in (a,b)\cap S$.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]] we must show that $S''\in S'$. This means that if $y \in S''$, for an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$ we must produce an element $x$ such that $x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$.

By definition of $y \in S''$, $\forall \delta >0$ $N_{\delta}^{*}(y)\cap S'\neq \emptyset$. Let $\delta=\epsilon$ in this case. Because the set is nonempty we can product an element $z$ inside of it. By construction this $z \in (y-\epsilon,y+\epsilon)$ and $z \in S'$. Because $z \in S'$ we can produce an $x$ such that for an arbitrary $\alpha$, $N_{\alpha}^{*}(z)\cap S\neq \emptyset$. Because $\delta$ is arbitrary, if we set it $=min\{ \left| (y+\epsilon) -z \right|, \left| z- (y-\epsilon) \right| \}$ $x$ is guaranteed to be in the interval $(y-\epsilon, y+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because $x$ must also be in $S$ we have assured that for an arbitrary $\epsilon$ $\exists x|x \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$. Thus that set is not empty and we have accomplished our goal.

##### Corollary 2.18
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Given a set $S \subseteq  R$, the set $cl(S)$ is a closed set.

By definition $cl(S):=S\cup S'$. Given any accumulation point of $cl(S)'$ we must show that it is in $cl(S)$ ([[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). If $y \in cl(S)'$ then for all $\epsilon>0$ there $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap(S\cup S')$ must be nonempty. This is logically equivalent to $(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S)\cup(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')\neq \emptyset$. This means that there exists a $z$ such that $z \in N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ *or* $z \in (N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S')$. If the first case is true, then by definition $y \in S'$. In the second case, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 2 16 1|#Lemma 2 16 1]] $N_{\epsilon}^{*}(y)\cap S$ must be nonempty, which again by definition makes $y \in S'$. Thus we have showed that for any point in $cl(S)'$, it must also be in $cl(S)=S\cup S'$, and by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]], it must be closed

##### Theorem 2.19
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of a finite number of closed sets is a closed set.

We must show that for any natural number $n\leq2$ the union of $n$ closed sets are closed.

Base case: for $n=2$, we simply have to refer to [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]].

Inductive hypothesis: Suppose that the union of $n$ closed sets is closed. We must show that the union of $n+1$ sets is closed.

By the inductive hypothesis for any sequence of closed sets $\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}$ is closed. $\cup_{i=2}^{n+1}C_{i}=\cup_{i=2}^{n}C_{i}\cup C_{n+1}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 2 16|#Corollary 2 16]] this must also be closed, and by mathematical induction the union of any finite set of closed intervals will be closed as well.

##### Theorem 2.20
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The intersection of any collection of closed sets is a closed set.

Suppose $\{S_{i}\}$ is a collection of closed sets, either finite or infinite. We must show that if for all values of $i$ $S_{i}$ will be closed, then the intersection of all of these sets is closed. We will do this through contradiction. 

Assume that the theorem is false, and there exists a collection of sets $S_{i}$ which are all closed, yet their intersection (denoted $\cap S_{i}$) is not closed. $\cap S_{i}$ not being closed implies that $(\cap S_{i})'\nsubseteq\cap S_{i}$ (by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]). Thus
$
\begin{align}
\exists x &\in (\cap S_{i})'|x \notin S_{i}, \text{ where }S_{i}\text{ is at least one of the sets}\\
\forall \epsilon&>0(N_{\epsilon}^{*}(x)\cap(\cap S_{i})\neq \emptyset)
\end{align}
$
This implies that for any $S_{i}$, $N_{\epsilon^{*}}(x)\cap S_{i}\neq0$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point for every $S_{i}$. Because each $S_{i}$ is closed this guarantees that $x \in S_{i}$, for all $S_{i}$ as well, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 12|#Exercise 2 12]]'s formulation of the definition of being closed. But this contradicts what we said earlier, finishing our proof.

##### Exercise 2.30*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S$ is **dense** in $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if every nonempty interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.

Let $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. From the definition of dense, we know that $\mathbb{R}\subseteq\text{cl}(S)$, or equivalently, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. This means that every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ is either an element of $S$ or is an accumulation point of $S$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $x\in\mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is an element of $S$, then we know that $(a,b)$ contains an element of $S$. If $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, then we know for some $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. In other words, the deleted neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one element of $S$. If $\epsilon<\text{min}\{|x-a|,|x-b|\}$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\subseteq (a,b)$. This means that at least one element of $S$ is also in $(a,b)$.

Therefore, if $S$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$, then every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $S$.


Suppose now that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S. This means for some distinct $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ where $\epsilon>0$ and some distinct $x\in\mathbb{R}$, the intervals $(x-\epsilon,x)$ and $(x,x+\epsilon)$ will each contain an element of $S$.

We can see that $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)=N_{\epsilon}^*(x)$, and since there is at least two elements of $S$ in $(x-\epsilon,x)\cup(x,x+\epsilon)$, then $N_{\epsilon}^*(x)\cap S$ is nonempty. This means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.

Since every $x\in\mathbb{R}$ can be described as an accumulation point of $S$, $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\cup S'$. Therefore if every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of S, then $S$ is dense in $R$.
 
##### Corollary 2.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  $Q$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

In order for $\mathbb{Q}$ to be dense in $\mathbb{R}$, it must be the case that every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$.

Consider the nonempty open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$. This interval must contain some $q\in\mathbb{Q}$, since between any two distinct real numbers there is at least one rational number. This means every nonempty open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ contains an element of $\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

##### Exercise 2.38*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use induction to prove that $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, each of length $(\frac{1}{3})^{n}$.

Base case: $C_{0}$ is the closed interval $[0,1]$ which clearly has length $1=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{0}$ , and there is only one interval ($1=2^{0}$). Thus the base case checks out.

Inductive hypothesis: We assume that $C_{n}$ has a $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, and we must show that $C_{n+1}$ has $2^{n+1}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

In definition of the Cantor set we were told that to construct the next "partial Cantor set" set you take each interval of the previous set and remove the open third of the interval. When you do this you split each interval into two intervals, doubling the number of intervals. Thus if $C_{n}$ has $2^{n}$ intervals, $C_{n+1}$ will have $2^{n}\cdot2=2^{n+1}$ intervals. When the middle third of each interval is removed the split intervals will have $\frac{1}{3}$ of the length of the interval they were split from. So if each interval in $C_{n}$ has length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$, then each interval in $C_{n+1}$ will have length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified, and by induction for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $C_{n}$ will have $2^{n}$ intervals each of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n+1}$.

##### Exercise 2.39*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Find at least three distinct points in the Cantor Set.

When we remove the middle third of each interval the endpoints of each interval are never removed. Thus an endpoint for $C_{n}$ will be an endpoint for every $C_{m}$ where $m>n$. In addition, because every $C_{n}$ is a subset of every $C_{l}$ where $l<n$, every endpoint of $C_{n}$ will be contained in $C_{l}$. Thus any endpoint of any of the sets will be in the Cantor set. Consider the set $\left\{  0,1, \frac{1}{3}  \right\}$. All the elements in the set are endpoints of $C_{1}$, so they must be in the Cantor set.

##### Exercise 2.40*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor Set is a closed set.

Every $C_{n}$ is a union of a finite number of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]] every $C_{n}$ is closed. Because $C_{\infty}$ is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, which are all closed, by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $C_{\infty}$ must be closed as well.

##### Exercise 2.41*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the Cantor set is nowhere **dense**.

To be nowhere dense there must be no $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. We will prove this by contradiction.

Assume there exists an $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $(a,b)\subseteq C_{\infty}$. Because the Cantor set is the intersection of every $C_{n}$, $(a,b)$ must be a subset of every $C_{n}$. Let $c= \left| a-b \right|$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] for some natural number $m$, $\frac{1}{m}<c$. $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{m}< \frac{1}{m}$ for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $C_{n}$ it will be made up of intervals of length $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. Thus we can produce a $C_{m}$ which is the union of a disjoint set of intervals, each of which are smaller than $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)$ cannot be a subset of $C_{m}$, otherwise $C_{m}$ would contain an interval larger than $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{n}$. This is contradiction, showing that our initial assumption is false, and the Cantor set must be **nowhere dense**.

### Chapter 3

#### 3.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 3.1
> [!none] 
> Let $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. A point $p \in S$ is said to be an interior point of $S$ if and only if there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_{\epsilon}(p)\subseteq S$. The set of all interior points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as the interior of $S$) will be denoted by $S^{\circ}$.

##### Definition 3.2
> [!none] 
> A point $q \in \mathbb{R}$ is said to be a boundary point of $S$ if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$, $N_{\epsilon}(q)$ contains at least one element of $S$ and at least one element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. The set of all boundary points of $S$ (usually referred to more concisely as **the boundary of $S$**) will be denoted by $\partial(S)$.

##### Exercise 3.3 
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For a set $S \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $\partial (S)=\partial (\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

If $T= \mathbb{R}\setminus S$, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus T=S$. For every boundary point no matter how small of an interval around that point there is there must be an element of $S$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But any element of $S$ is an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus T$, and every element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is an element of $T$. Therefore the point must be a boundary point for $T=\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well. Showing the implication the other way is very simple.

##### Exercise 3.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $S'$ is a subset of $\partial(S)$.

This is false. Consider the set $(0,1)$. $\frac{1}{2}$ is an accumulation point, but not a boundary point.

##### Exercise 3.5
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: For all sets $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $\partial(S)$ is a subset of $S'$.

This is also false. Consider the set $\{ 1 \}$. In this set $1$ is a boundary point, but not an accumulation point. I believe if the definition of a boundary point was a deleted epsilon neighborhood instead of a regular epsilon neighborhood, then this would be true.

##### Definition 3.8

##### Theorem 3.9
> [!none] 
> - [>]  An interval of the form $(a,b):=\{ x \in \mathbb{R}|a<x<b \}$ is an open set.

The definition of an interior point makes it clear that it must be an element of the set. Thus we only have to show that $(a,b)\subseteq (a,b)^{\circ}$.

For any point $x \in (a,b)$, if you take $\varepsilon=min\{ \left| x-a \right|,\left| b-x \right| \}$, then the interval $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will be contained in the set, making $x$ an interior point of $(a,b)$. Thus $(a,b)=(a,b)^{\circ}$.

3. $S=\mathbb{Z}$
	1. Not open. $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$, but $1 \notin S^{\circ}$
4. $S=\left\{  \frac{n-1}{n}|n \in\mathbb{N}  \right\}$

##### Exercise 3.11
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: the set $\mathbb{R}$, as well as the empty set $\emptyset$, are both open and closed.

We will prove this statement true.

The empty set has no interior points, so it is equal to its interior, making it technically open. It also has no accumulation points, so they must be a subset of the set, making it also closed.

For any real number, any open interval containing the number will be a subset of the real numbers. This makes every real number part of the interior of $\mathbb{R}$, and thus making it open. Every accumulation point of $\mathbb{R}$ must be in $\mathbb{R}$, making it closed as well. 

##### Exercise 3.12
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. If $T$ is not open, then $T$ is closed.

We will prove this false. Consider the set $(0,1]$. This set is not open, but it is also not closed, providing a counterexample to the statement.

#### 3.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 3.13
> [!none] 
> - [>]  A set $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. In other words, a set $S$ is open if and only if no boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

First we prove the forward direction: If $S$ is open, then all of the boundary are not elements of $S$.

For any $x \in \partial(S)$ by definition for all $\varepsilon>0$ the neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain a point in $S$ and a point not is $S$. Thus $N_{\varepsilon}$ cannot be a subset of $S$ because it contains an element not in $S$, meaning the point is not in the interior of $S$.

Next we prove the backward direction: If no boundary points are elements of $S$, then $S$ is an open set.

We will prove this by contraposition. The following statement is logically equivalent to the problem statement: If $S$ is not open, then there exists a boundary point which is an element of $S$.

If $S$ is not open that means there exists a point $x \in S|x \notin S^{\circ}$. Therefore for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ will contain an element not in $S$. But because $x \in S$ it contains both a point in $S$, and a point not in $S$, making it a boundary point in $S$.

##### Lemma 3.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $S \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $S'\setminus S=\partial(S)\setminus S$.

Suppose $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain a point in $S$ because $x\in S'$. But because the neighborhood contains $x$, it also contains a point not in $S$. Thus it satisfies the criteria to be a boundary point and is not in $S$, so $x \in \partial(S)\setminus S$.

Now suppose $y$ is a boundary point of $S$, but is not in $S$. For all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain one point in $S$ and one point not in $S$. Because $y \notin S$, the point in $S$ must be in $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$. Because we did this for an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$ this guarantees that $y \in S'$ by definition. We also know that $y \notin S$, so $y \in S'\setminus S$.

Because we have proved that $S'\setminus S\subseteq \partial(S)\setminus S$ and $\partial(S)\setminus S\subseteq S'\setminus S$, the two sets must be equal.

##### Lemma 3.14.1
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Let $S \in \mathbb{R}$. If $x$ is a boundary point of $S$, and is not contained in $S$, then $x$ is an accumulation point.

By the definition of a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$ $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ must contain at least one element of $S$. Because $x \notin S$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain the element of $S$. By definition this means that $x$ is an accumulation point of $S$.
##### Theorem 3.15
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is a closed set if and only if $\partial(S)\subseteq S$. In other words, a set $S$ is closed if and only if all boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$.

Suppose $S$ is closed. We must show that all of its boundary points are elements of $S$. Let $x \in \partial(S)$. 
Suppose $x \notin S$, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 3 14 1|#Lemma 3 14 1]] it would be an accumulation point of $S$. Because $S$ is closed this implies that $x \in S$. This is a contradiction, meaning our assumption must be false and $x$ must be in $S$.

Now suppose all of the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$. We must show that $S$ is closed. Let us do this through contradiction.
Assume that all the boundary points of $S$ are elements of $S$, but $S$ is not closed. By the definition of $S$ not being closed, there must be a $x \in S'|x\notin S$. This means that for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)$ must contain an element of $S$. $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, so $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ contains an element of $S$. Because it contains $x$ as well, it contains an element of $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ as well, thus satisfying the definition of a boundary point. This means that $x$ is a boundary point of $S$ not within $S$, contradicting our initial assumption and completing the proof.

##### Corollary 3.16
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is an open set if and only if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$.

First we must show the forward direction: If $S\in R$ is an open set, then $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set.

If $S$ is open, then by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $\partial(S)\subseteq(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 3 3|#Exercise 3 3]] $\partial(S)=\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)$. Therefore $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. Therefore by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

Now we must show the backward direction: If $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is a closed set, then $S$ is an open set.

By definition [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 15|#Theorem 3 15]] and $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ being closed we know that $\partial(\mathbb{R}\setminus S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. But this implies that $\partial(S)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\setminus S$. So by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] $S$ is open.

Q.E.D.

##### Theorem 3.17
> [!none]
> - [x]  The intersection of finitely many open sets is open

Consider $S=\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}S_{i}$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $S_{i}$ is open. Now consider the set $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$. Because $S_{i}$ is open [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]] guarantees $\mathbb{R}\setminus S_{i}$ must be closed. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must then be closed because it is a union of a finite number of closed intervals ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 19|#Theorem 2 19]]). Then again by Corollary 3.16 $S$ must be open if $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed.

##### Theorem 3.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  The union of any collection of open sets is open.

Let $X$ be any collection of open sets. Let our set $S=\bigcup\limits_{O\in S}O$ where every $O \in S$ is open. $\mathbb{R}\setminus S=\bigcap\limits_{O\in S}\mathbb{R}\setminus O$. Because every $O \in S$ is open, $\mathbb{R}\setminus O$ must be closed by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]]. This means that $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is the intersection of a collection of closed sets, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 2 20|#Theorem 2 20]] $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ must be closed. Because $\mathbb{R}\setminus S$ is closed, $S$ must be open by [[Mathematical Analysis#Corollary 3 16|#Corollary 3 16]].

##### Example 3.19
> [!none] 
> $F=\{ (1,4),(1,2),(3,7) \}$ is a collection of three open sets. Notice that the interval $(1,2)$ is an element of $F$ (not a subset of $F$) so we can write $(1,2)\in F$. At the same time we have that $\{ (1,2) \}\subseteq  F$.

$0 \in [0,1]$ is not in any interval of the form $(0,i)$ where $i \in I=\mathbb{N}$. Thus it is not "covered" by $F$.

##### Exercise 3.23
> [!none]

Consider the open set $(0,1)$. If we set $O_{1}=\left( 0, \frac{3}{4} \right)$, and $O_{2}=\left( \frac{1}{2}, 1 \right)$. Note that both sets are subsets of $(0,1)$. Let $I=\{ 1,2 \}$. Let $F=\{ O_{i}|i \in I \}$. $\bigcup\limits_{O \in F}O=(0,1)$ and thus $F$ is an open cover comprised of only subsets of $(0,1)$.

> [!none] 
> - [x]  Develop complete proofs of all the lemmas, theorems, and corollaries previously presented in this chapter.

##### Exercise 3.26*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or Disprove: Suppose $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $S\setminus S'=S\setminus \partial(S)$.

We will prove this statement false. Consider the natural numbers. Clearly the set $N_{0.5}^{*}(1)\cap \mathbb{N}$ empty, and thus by definition $1$ cannot be an accumulation point and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}'$.

We must now show that $1$ *is* a boundary point for $\mathbb{N}$. If we consider any $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ will contain an element of $\mathbb{N}$ (namely, $1$). If we consider the deleted neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(1)=(1-\varepsilon,1+\varepsilon)$, it is an interval, so it must contain an infinite amount of points. But in between any two real numbers ($1-\varepsilon$ and $1+\varepsilon$) there can only be a finite number of natural numbers. Thus there must be elements in the interval which are not in $\mathbb{N}$ and for every $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(1)$ contains an element of the natural numbers, and element not in the natural numbers, satisfying the definition of a boundary point.

Obviously $1\in \mathbb{N}$, so we have show that $1 \in \mathbb{N}\setminus \partial(\mathbb{N})$ and $1 \notin \mathbb{N}\setminus  \mathbb{N}'$. Thus the two sets are not equal and the statement has been disproven.

##### Exercise 3.27
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ closed and $T$ is open, then $S\cap T$ is not open.

This is false. Consider $S=[0,10]$ and $T=(2,6)$. $S\cap T=(2,6)$, which is open.

##### Exercise 3.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $T\setminus S$ is open.

We will disprove this statement. Let $T=[0,10]$ and $S=(4,6)$. $T\setminus S=[0,4]\cup [6,10]$, which is a closed set.

##### Exercise 3.29*
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Prove or disprove: Suppose $S,T \in \mathbb{R}$. If $S$ is open and $T$ is closed then $S\setminus T$ is open.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 3 13|#Theorem 3 13]] if we can show for all elements $x \in \partial(S\setminus T)$, $x\notin S\setminus T$, then $S\setminus T$ must be open. $x \notin S\setminus T$ is equivalent to $x \in T \lor x \notin S$.

Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $\partial(S\setminus T)$. We must show that $x \in T$, or $x$ is not in $S$ in order to prove that $S\setminus T$ is open. 

By the definition of a boundary point for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $y \in N_{\varepsilon}(x)$ such that $y \in R\setminus(S\setminus T)\Leftrightarrow y \in T \lor y \notin S$.

In the case where $y \notin S$, it is impossible for $x$ to be an interior point. Because $S$ is open, that means that $x \notin S$.
In the case where $y \in T$, we have that $x$ is an accumulation point. Because $T$ is closed, this implies $x \in T$.

Both of these outcomes are sufficient to guarantee that $S\setminus T$ is open.

##### Theorem 3.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $cl(S)=S \cup \partial(S)$.

First we will show that $cl(S)=S\cup S'\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$. Let $x$ be an element of $S\cup S'$. If $x \in S$ then it is clearly also in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Consider the case where $x \notin S$ and $x \in S'$. If we consider neighborhood $N_{\varepsilon}(x)$, it must include an element not in $S$ (namely, $x$), and because it is an accumulation point it must also contain an element *in* $S$. By definition this makes it an accumulation point. Thus every element of $S\cup S'$ is an element of $S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S\cup S'\subseteq S \cup \partial(S)$.

Now we must show that $S\cup \partial(S)\subseteq S\cup S'$. Consider a $y$ in $S\cup \partial(S)$. Again, if $y$ is in $S$ it obviously must be in $S\cup S'$. Consider the case where it is not and $y \in \partial(S)$ and $y \notin S$. Because $y$ is a boundary point, for all $\varepsilon>0$, $N_{\varepsilon}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$. $y$ is not in $S$, so $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(y)$ must contain an element of $S$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. By definition this makes $y \in S'$ and thus $y \in S\cup S'$.

Thus we have show that $cl(S)\subseteq S\cup \partial(S)$ and $S \cup \partial(S) \subseteq cl(S)$, so they must be equal.

##### Exercise 3.31*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S=(0,1)$ and let $F=\left\{  \left( 0,1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)|n \in \mathbb{N}  \right\}$. Is $F$ an open cover for $S$? Show that there is no finite subset of $F$ which also covers $S$.

We will prove that $F$ is indeed an open cover for $(0,1)$. 

If we consider any number $x \in (0,1)$, there will always exist an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{n}<1-x$ by [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]]. Therefore $x<1-\frac{1}{n}$. We also know that $x>0$ (because $x \in (0,1)$), so $x \in \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By construction this means that $x$ is in one of the elements of $S$, and thus must be in the union of all of the elements of $F$. Because $x$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, this implies that $F$ is an open cover for $(0,1)$.

For any finite subset of $F$ which we will call $F'$, consider the set $S=\left\{  n \in \mathbb{N}|\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{n} \right)\in F'  \right\}$. Because this set is finite we can select a maximal element which we will call $b$. Notice that for every $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$ if $x<y$ then $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{x} \right)\subseteq\left( 0,1-\frac{1}{y} \right)$. We selected $b$ as a maximal element of $S$, so for every interval in $F'$, it must be a subset of $\left( 0,1 -\frac{1}{b} \right)$. Thus if there is a number which is not in $\left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$ it will not be in any element of $F'$.

Now consider the endpoint of that interval $1-\frac{1}{b}$. Because it is an open interval $1-\frac{1}{b}\notin \left( 0,1- \frac{1}{b} \right)$. $b$ is a natural number, so $\frac{1}{b}$ is less than one (in the case where $b=1$ the set would be empty), and greater than zero. Thus $0<1- \frac{1}{b}<1$, and $1- \frac{1}{b} \in (0,1)$. We have produced a number which is in $(0,1)$, but is not "covered" by $F$.

#### 4.1 Preliminary Work

##### Definition 4.1
> [!none] 
> A function $a:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ is called a sequence. When discussing a sequence, we will typically denote individual elements of the range using subscripts: $a_{i}:=a(1),a_{2}:=a(2)$, etc. We will then denote the entire sequence by $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$, or $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots)$, or simple just by $a_{n}$.

##### Example 4.2
> [!none] 
> The sequence $(n^{2})_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,4,9,16,\dots)$ is the sequence of each of the natural numbers squared. It is clear that the further we go in the sequence, the larger the sequence elements become.

##### Example 4.3
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \sin\left( \frac{\pi n}{2} \right) \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}=(1,0,-1,0,1,0,-1,0)$ is a sequence that taeks on the values of $1,0,$ and $-1$ in a repeating pattern. It is clear that the pattern displayed in this sequence will continue forever.

##### Example 4.4
> [!none] 
> The sequence $\left( \frac{n+5}{n} \right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has its first few terms as 5,3,7/3,2,9/5,5/3,... It appears that the terms in this sequence are getting smaller; but it is unclear at first glance whether this trend continues. If we look out a bit into the sequence, we see that $a_{100}=\frac{105}{100}=1.05$, and if go really far we see that $a_{8745}\approx 1.00057$. So it seems like the "long-term" behavior of this sequence is to have sequence elements that "get close to" the number 1.

##### Definition 4.5
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to **converge to a number** $L$ if and only if $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that if $n>N$ then $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. In this case, we say that the $(a_{n})$ is a **convergent sequence** and that the number $L$ is a **limit** of the sequence ($a_{n}$).

##### Definition 4.6
> [!none] 
> A sequence ($a_{n}$) is said to **eventually** have a property $P$ if and only if there exists an $N$ such that, whenever $n>N$, $a_{n}$ has property $P$. In other words: ($a_{n}$) eventually has property $P$ if there exists an $N$ such that every term with index greater than $N$ has property $P$.

##### Exercise 4.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }$. Show that $a_{n}$ will eventually be greater than or equal to $10$. 

We will do this through proof by induction.

Base case: $a_{100}=10$.

Inductive hypothesis: $\sqrt{ n+x }$ is always greater than $\sqrt{ n }$ if $x>0$. Thus if if any $a_{n}=\sqrt{ n }\geq10$, then $a_{n+1}=\sqrt{ n+1 }$ must be as well. Thus the inductive hypothesis has been verified and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}\geq100$, $a_{n}\leq10$ .

##### Theorem 4.8 (Uniqueness of Limits)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L$, and also converges to a number $M$. Then $L=M$.

$L=M$ if and only if $\left| L-M \right|<0$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. Suppose we choose an $N$ such that if $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ and $\left| a_{n}-M \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. By the triangle inequality
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-L-(a_{n}-M) \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\left| M-L \right| <\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus $M$ must equal $L$.

##### Example 4.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0$.
> 

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] $\frac{1}{n}$ can be smaller than any real number. Consider $\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|=\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|$. For any $\varepsilon>0$ we can produce an $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is smaller than it, so the limit must be 0.

##### Example 4.10
> [!none] 
> Use the definition of limit to prove that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{2n+1}{3n+4}= \frac{2}{3}$.

This proof is not that hard, but very lengthy, so just refer to the books if you need to.

##### Exercise 4.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Use the definition of a limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}=1$.

$\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{n-1}{n}= \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } 1 - \frac{1}{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 9|#Example 4 9]] we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{n}=0$, so our limit must equal 1.

##### Exercise 4.12
> [!none] 
> - [ ]  Use the definition of limit to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{4n-5}{n+2}=4$.

This is essentially identical to [[Mathematical Analysis#Example 4 10|#Example 4 10]]. 
##### Exercise 4.13
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. What does it mean for a number $L$ to not a a limit of $a_{n}$?

If $L$ is a limit of $a_{n}$ that means
$
\forall \varepsilon>0, \exists N \in\mathbb{N}|\forall n>N (\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon)
$

For $L$ to not be a limit of $a_{n}$ we negate the definition to get
$
\exists\varepsilon>0|\forall N \in\mathbb{N},\exists n>N|(\left| a_{n}-L \right| \geq\varepsilon )
$

In words: There exists an $\varepsilon$ greater than zero such that for all $N$ in the natural numbers there will exists an $n$ greater than $N$ such that $a_{n}$ is not within a distance $\varepsilon$ of $L$.

##### Exercise 4.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,\dots)$ does not converge to the number 1.

Consider an $\varepsilon=0.5$. For any $N$ there will always be an $n$ such that $a_{n}=-1$ and $\left| a_{n}-1 \right|=2\geq0.5$. Thus the definition for not being a limit point as given in the previous exercise has been fulfilled and $1$ is not a limit of the sequence.

#### 4.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 4.15 (First Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B \text{ and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}-b_{n})=A-B.
> \end{align}
> $

$(i)$
Let $\varepsilon>0$.
By definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall n>N_{1},\left| a_{n}-A \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall n>N_{2},\left| b_{n}-B \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \\
\end{align}
$
Let $N=max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$. For all $n>N$
$
\begin{align}
&\left| a_{n}+b_{n}-(A+B) \right|= \left| (a_{n}-A)+(b_{n}-B) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-A \right|+\left| b_{n}-B \right|  < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
The triangle allows the first line to be less than or equal to the second line.
By definition this means that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}+b_{n})=A+B$.

$(ii)$
Consider the sequence $-b_{n}$. We will show that its limit is $-B$. $\left| -b_{n}-(-B) \right|=\left| B-b_{n} \right|$ which we can make arbitrarily small cause $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$. Then we just use the previous result and add $a_{n}+(-b_{n})$, and their limits will add, meaning $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }(a_{n}-b_{n}=A-B)$

##### Theorem 4.16 (Second Algebraic Limit Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }=B \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
> $
> \begin{align}
> &(i) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } (a_{n}\cdot b_{n})=A\cdot B \\
> &\text{ Also, if $B\neq0$, then $b_{n}\neq0$ for sufficiently large n and}\\
> &(ii) \lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \left( \frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}} \right)=\frac{A}{B}
> \end{align}
> $

$(i)$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}b_{n}-AB \right|&=\left| a_{n}b_{n}-Ab_{n}+Ab_{n}-AB \right|  \\
&= \left| b_{n}(a_{n}-A) +A(b_{n}-B)\right| \\
&\leq \left| b_{n} \right| \left| a_{n} -A\right|+\left| A \right| \left| b_{n}-B \right|   
\end{align}
$

By definition of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ we can make $\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ and $\left| b_{n}-B \right|$ as small as we would like. Thus the only thing we need to show in order to make the expression less than $\varepsilon$ is to show that $b_{n}$ will be bounded, so we can make $\left| b_{n} \right|\left| a_{n}-A \right|$ as small as we would like. A much more fleshed out argument is given in the book.

$(ii)$
The crux of this proof is in the fact that
$
\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right| =\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{B\cdot b_{n}} \right| 
$
and we can make $B-b_{n}$ as small as we want, and $B\cdot b_{n}$ is bounded. Thus $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$, and then we can just think of this as the multiplication of two series.
##### Theorem 4.17 (Order Limit Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence that converges to a limit $A$. If $a_{n}\geq0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq0$.

We will prove by contradiction. Suppose that $A<0$. By definition of a limit we can produce an $a_{n}$ such that $\left| a_{n}-A \right|<\left| A \right|$. Because $a_{n}>A$ and $A<0$ this is equivalent to $a_{n}-A<-A$. But this would imply that $a_{n}$ is negative, giving us our contradiction.

##### Corollary 4.18
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ and $(b_{n})$ be sequences that converge to limits $A$ and $B$, respectfully. If $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A\geq B$.

Consider the sequence $c_{n}=a_{n}-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 15 First Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B$. Because $a_{n}\geq b_{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $a_{n}-b_{n}\leq0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Thus by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 4 17 Order Limit Theorem for Sequences]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=A-B\geq0\to A\geq B$. 

##### Definition 4.19
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **bounded** if and only if $\exists B>0$ such that $\left| a_{n} \right|<B$, $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. In other words, a sequence is bounded if there exists two number $B_{1},B_{2}$ such that $B_{1}<a_{n}<B_{2}$ for every sequence element $a_{n}$.

##### Definition 4.20
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **increasing** (resp. strictly increasing) if and only if $a_{n+1}>a_{n}$ ($a_{n+1}>a_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Similarly, a sequence $(b_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is said to be **decreasing** (strictly decreasing) if and only if $b_{n+1}\leq b_{n}$ ($b_{n+1}<b_{n}$), $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. A sequence is said to be **monotone** if and only if the sequence is increasing or is decreasing.

##### Theorem 4.21 (Monotone Convergence Theorem)
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Every bounded monotone sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ converges.

We will prove that every bounded increasing sequence will converge, but the proof that every bounded decreasing sequence will converge is structured exactly the same.

Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ is bounded and increasing. Let $S=\{ a_{n}|n \in \mathbb{N} \}$, and $m=\text{ sup}(S)$ (we know that $\text{ sup}(S)$ exists because $S$ is bounded). We will use $m$ as a candidate limit for $a_{n}$. Let $\varepsilon>0$. There must exists an $x \in S$ such that $m-\varepsilon<x<m$, by the definition of a supremum. Because $x \in S$ that means $\exists l \in N|a_{l}=x$ and $m-\varepsilon<a_{l}<\varepsilon$. $a_{n}$ is increasing, so for every $n>l$, $m>a_{n}>a_{l}>m-\varepsilon$ ($a_{n}$ must be $<m$ because $m$ is the supremum). Therefore every element after $a_{l} \in N_{\varepsilon}(m)$, and thus $m$ must be the limit of the sequence.

##### Lemma 4.23
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $b_{n}$ converges to a number $B\neq 0$. Then there exists a constant $\alpha>0$ such that $\left| b_{n} \right|>\alpha$ for all $n$ sufficiently large. (Here, we say that $b_{n}$ is eventually bounded away from zero.)

First we will show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$. Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

Because $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=B$ there must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N$, $b_{n}\in N_{B}(B)$. Let $n>N$.

If $B\geq0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{+}$ so every $b_{n}$ must be positive. If this is the case then $\left| b_{n} \right|=b_{n}$ and clearly the two must have the same limit $\left| B \right|=B$.
If $B<0$ then $N_{B}(B)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{-}$ and every $b_{n}$ must be negative. Thus $\left| b_{n} \right|=-b_{n}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem|#Theorem 4 16 Second Algebraic Limit Theorem]] $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }-b_{n}=-B=\left| B \right|$. Thus is both cases $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|=\left| B \right|$.

Using this fact let we know that $0<\left| B \right|=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }\left| b_{n} \right|$. Let $\alpha$ be a real number such that $0<\alpha<\left| B \right|$. We can now produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\forall n>N, \left| b_{n} \right|\in N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(\left| B \right|)$. Every element in $N_{\left| B \right|-\alpha}(B)$ is greater than $\alpha$, so we $N$ is the number we were seeking to produce and we are done.

\begin{align}
&\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}  -\frac{1}{B} \right|=\left| \frac{B-b_{n}}{Bb_{n}} \right| =\left| \frac{1}{Bb_{n}} \right|\left| B-b_{n} \right|    \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha} \right| \left| B-b_{n} \right|  \\
&<\left| \frac{1}{B\alpha } \right| \left| B\alpha \cdot \varepsilon  \right| =\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$
Therefore for all $\varepsilon>0$ there exists an $N$ such that $\forall n >N$, $\left| \frac{1}{b_{n}}-\frac{1}{B} \right|<\varepsilon$ and thus by definition $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty } \frac{1}{b_{n}}= \frac{1}{B}$. We know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=A$, so using part $(i)$. of the Second Algebraic Limit Theorem we know that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\cdot \frac{1}{b_{n}}=A/B$.

##### Theorem 4.25 (The Squeeze Theorem for Sequences)*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$, and $c_{n}$ are three sequences, and suppose $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}$. If $a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}$ for all $n$ sufficiently large, then $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L.$

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.

By the definition of a limit
$
\begin{align}
\exists N_{1}|\forall  n >N_{1},\left| a_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\exists N_{2}|\forall  n >N_{2},\left| b_{n}-L \right| <\varepsilon \\
\end{align}
$
Let $n>max\{ N_{1},N_{2} \}$
$
\begin{align}
\left| L-a_{n} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
L-a_{n}&<\varepsilon \\
a_{n}&>L-\varepsilon \\
\left| b_{n}-L \right| &<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}-L&<\varepsilon \\
b_{n}&<\varepsilon+L
\end{align}
$
Therefore
$
\displaylines{
L-\varepsilon<a_{n}\leq c_{n}\leq b_{n}<\varepsilon+L\\
-\varepsilon<c_{n}-L<\varepsilon
}
$
Thus $\left| c_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$, and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }c_{n}=L$.

##### Exercise 4.26
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Let $a_{n}$ be a sequence. Show that if $a_{n}$ converges to a limit $L$, then $a_{n}$ is bounded.

Choose a specific $\varepsilon>0$. By the definition of a limit $\exists N$ such that $\forall n>N, a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Thus every term after $a_{N}$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon+L$ and bounded below by $L-\varepsilon$. If we look at the sequence $a_{1-(N-1)}$, it is finite, so it must have an upper bound $M_{1}$ and a lower bound $B_{1}$. If we let $M=max\{ M_{1},\varepsilon+L \}$ and $B=\{ B_{1},L-\varepsilon \}$ then $M$ and $B$ will bound the whole sequence.

##### Defintion 4.27
> [!none] 
> We say that a sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is **in a set** $S$ if and only if $a_{n} \in S$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

##### Lemma 4.28
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $a_{n}$ is a sequence in $S$, and suppose $a_{n}$ converges to a number $L.$ Then $L \in S\cup S'$.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. 

Case 1: $L \in S$. We are done.

Case 2: $L\notin S$. We must show that $L \in S'$.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By the definition of a limit, $\exists N$ such that for all $n>N$ $a_{n}\in N_{\varepsilon}(L)$. Suppose that every sequence element $a_{n}=L$. This would mean that the limit $L$ would equal $a_{n}$, which is an element of $S$, giving a contradiction. So there must be at least one $a_{i}$ where $i\geq n$ and $a_{i} \neq L$. Thus $a_{i}\in N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(L)$ and we have satisfied the definition of an accumulation point for $L$.

##### Lemma 4.29*
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $S$ be a set. If $x \in S'$, then there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ that satisfies $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

By the definition of an accumulation point $N_{\varepsilon}^{*}(x)\cap S$ is nonempty for all $\varepsilon>0$. Notice that this set is equivalent to $N_{\varepsilon}(x)\cap S\setminus \{ x \}$. Thus for any epsilon we can produce a $y \in S\setminus \{ x \}$ in that epsilon neighborhood. Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists y_{1}|y_{1} \in N_{1}(x) \\
&\exists y_{2}|y_{2} \in N_{\frac{1}{2}}(x) \\
&\exists y_{3}|y_{3} \in N_{\frac{1}{3}}(x) \\
&\vdots\\
&\exists y_{n}|y_{n} \in N_{\frac{1}{n}}(x) \\
\end{align}
$
Where every $y_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (Notice that every $y_{n}$ does not have to be distinct; the function will just not be 1-1).

Now consider the sequence $a_{n}=y_{n}$. Because every $y_{n} \in S\setminus \{ x \}$, $a_{n}$ is in $S\setminus \{ x \}$. We now have to show that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. 

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be given. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|Theorem 1.3]] we can produce an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<\varepsilon$. Consider any $a_{m}$ such that $m>N$. $a_{m} \in N_{\frac{1}{m}}(x)\subseteq N_{\frac{1}{N}}(x)\subseteq N_{\varepsilon}$. Thus for every $m>N$ $\left| a_{m}-x \right|<\varepsilon$ and $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$.

##### Corollary 4.30
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $T\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $p \in cl(T)$ if and only if there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $T$ such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} = p$.

First we will show the forward direction: If $p \in cl(T)$ then there exists a sequence such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$. [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] guarantees that if $p \in S'$ then we can produce such a sequence. Thus we only have to consider the case where $p \in S$, which is trivial because obviously the sequence $a_{n}=p,\forall n \in N$ converges to $p$.

[[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] Proves the backward direction.

##### Theorem 4.31
> [!none] 
> - [x]  A set $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

Forward direction: If $S$ is closed, then every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n} \in S$.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 28|#Lemma 4 28]] if $a_{n}$ converges, it must converge to an element in $S\cup S'=cl(S)$, but because $S$ is closed $cl(S)=S$, and thus $a_{n}$ must converge to an element in $S$.

Backward direction: If every convergent sequence $a_{n}$ in $S$ has the property that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}\in S$, then $S$ is closed.

Let $x \in S'$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4 29|#Lemma 4 29]] there exists a sequence $a_{n}$ in $S\setminus \{ x \}$ (and thus also in $S$), such that $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=x$. By our assumption this means that $x \in S$. Thus we have proved that $S'\subseteq S$ and $S$ is closed.

##### Definition 4.32

Similarly, a sequence $c_{n}$ is said to diverge to negative infinity if and only if $\forall P<0,\exists M>0$ such that if $n\geq M$, then $c_{n}<P$.

##### Exercise 4.33
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $(\sqrt{ n })$ diverges to $\infty$.

Let $P>0$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle|#Axiom 1 2 The Archimedean Principle]] there exists an $N$ such that $N>P^{2}\to \sqrt{ N }>P$. Thus for all $n\geq N$, $\sqrt{ n }>P$, and $\sqrt{ n }$ diverges to $\infty$.

##### Exercise 4.34*

### Chapter 5

#### 5.1 Preliminary Work

##### Defintion 5.1
> [!none] 
> A sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be **Cauchy** if and only if for every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists an $M>0$ such that $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ for all integers $n,m\geq M$.

##### Exercise 5.2
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Show that the sequence $\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$ is a Cauchy sequence.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

By [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 1 3|#Theorem 1 3]] we can produce an $M>0$ such that for all $n>M$ $\left| \frac{1}{n} \right|<\varepsilon$. Let $m>M$ as well. Because $\frac{1}{m}$ is positive and less than $\frac{1}{n}$, $\left| \frac{1}{n} -\frac{1}{m}\right|<\left| \frac{1}{n}-0 \right|<\varepsilon$. Thus $\frac{1}{n}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.3
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L \in \mathbb{R}$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is Cauchy.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

Let $M$ be a number such that for $\forall n>M$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|< \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$, and suppose that $n$ and $m$ are both greater than $M$.

$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| &=\left| (a_{n}-L)+(L-a_{m}) \right|  \\
&\leq \left| a_{n}-L \right| +\left| L-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon 
\end{align}
$

Thus for any $n,m>M$, $\forall\varepsilon>0$, $\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon$ and so $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence.

##### Lemma 5.4
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If a sequence is Cauchy, then it is bounded

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value.

There exists an $M>0$ such that for all $n,m>M$
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right|<\varepsilon  
\end{align}
$
Let $n$ be fixed and set $a_{n}=A$.
$
\begin{align}
\left| a_{m}-A \right| &<\varepsilon  \\
a_{m}-A&<\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&<\varepsilon+A \\
\left| A-a_{m} \right| &<\varepsilon \\
A-a_{m}&<\varepsilon \\ 
a_{m}-A&>-\varepsilon \\
a_{m}&>A-\varepsilon
\end{align}
$

Thus $A-\varepsilon$ is a lower bound and $A+\varepsilon$ is an upper bound for every element after $a_{M}$. The sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{M}$ is finite and thus must be bounded above by some number $B$ and bounded below by $-B$. Thus $min\{ A-\varepsilon,-B \}$ must be a lower bound for the whole sequence, and $max\{ A+\varepsilon,B \}$ must be an upper bound for the whole sequence.

##### Definition 5.6
> [!none] 
> Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is called a **subsequence** of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$. If a subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L_{1}$ then we say that $L_{1}$ is a **subsequential limit** of the original sequence $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$.

##### Exercise 5.7
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})=\left( \frac{1}{n} \right)$. Explain why $\left( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots \right)$ is a subsequence of $(a_{n})$, but $\left( 1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{4},\dots \right)$ is not.

In the first case the subsequence is strictly increasing (the denominators are always going up), while in the second case it is not.

##### Exercise 5.8
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Let $(a_{n})$ be a sequence, where $a_{n}$ is defined to be $\frac{1}{n}$ if $n$ is even, and $\frac{n}{n+4}$ if $n$ is odd.

> 2. Let $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2k)_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2,4,8,\dots)$. Write out the first few terms of the subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})$. What is your conjecture for the value of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{m_{k}}$?
> 3. Let $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}=(2k-1)_{k=1}^{\infty}=(1,3,5,7,\dots)$. Write out the first few terms of the subsequence $(a_{m_{k}})$. What is your conjecture for the value of $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{m_{k}}$?

1. $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{8}= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{7}{11}, \frac{1}{8}$
2. $(a_{2k})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{6},\dots$ This seems like it will approach 0.
3. $(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^{\infty }= \frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{5}{9}, \frac{7}{11},\dots$ This seems to be approaching $\frac{1}{2}$.

##### Lemma 5.9
> [!none] 
> - [x]  If $(m_{k})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers, then $m_{k}\geq k$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$.

We will prove by induction.

Base case: $k=1$. if $m_{k}$ is in the natural numbers then it must be $\geq1=k$. Thus the base case is verified.

Induction hypothesis: Assume that for some natural number $k$, $m_{k}\geq k$. We must then show that $m_{k+1}\geq k+1$. This is very straightforward to verify because $m_{k}$ is strictly increasing.

#### 5.2 Main Theorems

##### Theorem 5.10
> [!none] 
> - [>]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ and $l \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$ if and only if all subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$.

Forward direction: If $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $L$, then all of the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ as well.
Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value. There must exists an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n>N$, $\left| a_{n}-L \right|<\varepsilon$. Every $a_{m_{k}}$ where $m_{k}>N$ must be within this epsilon range as well, making it convergent.

Backward direction: If all the subsequences of $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $L$ then $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must as well.
This proof is trivial, because $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a subsequence of itself.

##### Theorem 5.11
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence and let $b_{k}:=a_{2k}$ and $c_{k}:=a_{2k+1}$. Show that $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to a number $L$ if and only if both $(b_{k})$ and $(c_{k})$ converges to $L$.

This is just applying the theorem above?

##### Lemma 5.12 (Monotone Subsequence Lemma)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a monotone subsequence.

Let $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. We will call a term $a_{M}$ a **dominant term** if and only if $a_{M}>a_{n}$ for all $n>M$.

There must either be a finite amount of dominant terms for $(a_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or an or an infinite amount.

If there is an infinite number of dominant terms, then the subsequence $\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ of dominant terms will be decreasing by definition of a dominant term.

If there is a finite amount of dominant terms there must exists a greatest dominant term (greatest not in value, but in its placement in the sequence), $a_{N}$. Thus for all $n>N$, $a_{n}$ cannot be a dominant term. By negating the definition of a dominant term, we get the following fact:

> [!none] 
> For every $n>N$  there must exists an $m>n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_{m}\geq a_{n}$.

Thus
$
\begin{align}
&\exists m_{1}>N+1:a_{m_{1}}\geq a_{N+1}\\
&\exists m_{2}>m_{1}:a_{m_{2}}\geq a_{m_{1}}\\
&\exists m_{3}>m_{1}:a_{m_{3}}\geq a_{m_{2}}\\
&\vdots\\
&\exists m_{k}>m_{k-1}:a_{m_{k}}\geq a_{m_{k-1}}\\
\end{align}
$
Thus if we set $\{ a_{n_{k}} \}=\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ by construction the sequence will be increasing and thus monotone.

In both the case where there are a finite number of dominant terms, and in the case where there is an infinite number, we can produce a monotone sequence.

##### Theorem 5.13 (Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ has a convergent subsequence.

Combining the [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem|#Theorem 4 21 Monotone Convergence Theorem]] with [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma|#Lemma 5 12 Monotone Subsequence Lemma]] gives us the desired result.

##### Lemma 5.14
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Suppose $(a_{n})$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$. If $(a_{n})$ has a convergent subsequence, then $a_{n}$ must converge.

Let $\varepsilon>0$ be a fixed value and $(a_{m_{k}})_{k=1}^{\infty}$ be a convergent subsequence within $(a_{n})$.
$
\exists N_{1}|\forall k>N_{1}  \left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$
$
\exists N_{2}\forall n,m>N\left| a_{n}-a_{m} \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$

Let $k>N_{1}$ and $n,m>N_{2}$.
$
\left| a_{n}-L \right| \leq \left| a_{n}-a_{m_{k}} \right| +\left| a_{m_{k}}-L \right| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}+ \frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon.
$

##### Theorem 5.15 (Cauchy Criterion)
> [!none] 
> - [x]  Every Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\mathbb{R}$ converges to a number in $\mathbb{R}$.

1. Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. (Easy to prove the same way we did for convergent sequences in [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 4 26|#Exercise 4 26]]).
2. Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence ([[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 5 13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences]])
3. $\therefore$ Every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence.
4. Every Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges ([[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 5 14|#Lemma 5 14]]).

##### Theorem 5.18 (Bolazno-Weierstrass Theorem for Sets)*
> [!none] 
> - [>]  If $B$ is a bounded infinite subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $B$ must have at least one accumulation point (i.e., $B'\neq \emptyset$).

Let $B$ be an infinite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and let $S$ be a countably infinite subset of $B$. By definition of a countable set there is a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\to S$. A sequence is just a function from the natural numbers to the reals,  so $f$ gives us a sequence $\{ a_{n} \}$ which is in $S$. Because $\{ a_{n} \}$ is in $S$ and $S$ is bounded, $\{ a_{n} \}$ must also be bounded. And by [[Mathematical Analysis#Theorem 5.13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences|#Theorem 5.13 Bolzano-Wiererstrass Theorem for Sequences]] there must be a convergent subsequence $\{ a_{m_{k}} \}$ in $S$ which converges to some number $L$.

Because the the function $f$ which $\{ a_{n} \}$ was constructed from was a bijection, *every sequence term will be unique* and every element in $S$ will appear in the series. That means that if some term $a_{m_{i}}=L$, it will be the only term to do so. Now consider the modified sequence $\{ b_{n} \}$ such that
$
b_{n}=
\begin{cases}
a_{m_{n}}&\text{If $a_{m_{n}}\neq L$}\\
a_{m_{n-1}}&\text{If $a_{m_{n}}= L$}
\end{cases}
$
Clearly $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=L$, because we have only changed at most one term. But in making this slight modification we have ensured that $L$ does not appear in $b_{n}$. This means that $\{ b_{n} \}$ is in $S\setminus \{ L \}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4.28|#Lemma 4.28]] $L \in (S\setminus \{ L \})\cup(S\setminus \{ L \})'$. By definition it is not in $S\setminus \{ L \}$, so it must be an accumulation point of $S\setminus \{ L \}$.

$S\setminus \{ L \}\subseteq B$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 25|#Exercise 2 25]] $(S\setminus \{ L \})'\subseteq B'$. Thus because $L \in(S\setminus \{ L \})\subseteq B'$, $B'\neq \emptyset$.

Because the the function $f$ which $\{ a_{n} \}$ was constructed from was a bijection, *every sequence term will be unique* and every element in $S$ will appear in the series. That means that if some term $a_{m_{i}}=L$, it will be the only term to do so. Now consider the modified sequence $\{ b_{n} \}$ such that
$
b_{n}=
\begin{cases}
a_{m_{n}}&\text{If $a_{m_{n}}\neq L$}\\
a_{m_{n-1}}&\text{If $a_{m_{n}}= L$}
\end{cases}
$
Clearly $\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }a_{n}=\lim\limits_{ n \to \infty }b_{n}=L$, because we have only changed at most one term. But in making this slight modification we have ensured that $L$ does not appear in $b_{n}$. This means that $\{ b_{n} \}$ is in $S\setminus \{ L \}$. By [[Mathematical Analysis#Lemma 4.28|#Lemma 4.28]] $L \in (S\setminus \{ L \})\cup(S\setminus \{ L \})'$. By definition it is not in $S\setminus \{ L \}$, so it must be an accumulation point of $S\setminus \{ L \}$.

$S\setminus \{ L \}\subseteq B$, so by [[Mathematical Analysis#Exercise 2 25|#Exercise 2 25]] $(S\setminus \{ L \})'\subseteq B'$. Thus because $L \in(S\setminus \{ L \})\subseteq B'$, $B'\neq \emptyset$.
